Studies serve for delight,for ornament,and for ability.Their chief use for delight,is in privateness and retiring; for ornament, is in discourse; and for ability, is in the judgement and disposition of business. For ecpert and execute, and perhaps judge of particulars, one by one; but the general counsels, and the plots and marshalling of affairs, come best form those that are learned. To spend too much time in studies is sloth; to use them too much for ornament, is affectation; to make judgement wholly by their rules, is the humour of a scholar. They perfect nature, and are perfectec by experience: for natural abilities are like natural plants, that need proyning by study; and studies themselves do give forth directions too much at large, except they be bounded in by experience. Crafty men contemn studies, simple men admire them, and wise men use them; for they teach not their own use; but that is a wisdom without them, and above them, won by observation. An empty street, an empty house,  a hole inside my heart I'm all alone, the rooms are getting smaller. I wander how, I wander why, I wander where they are The days we had, the songs we sang together. Oh yeah And oh my love, I'm holding on forever Reaching for a love that seems so far So I say a little prayer And hope my dreams will take me there Where the skies are blue, to see you once again ... my love  Overseas from coast  to coast To find the place I love the most Where the fields are green, to see you once again.. my love I try to read, I go to work I'm laughing with my friends But I can't stop to keep myself from thinking.

Welcome to the Hotel California Such a lovely place Such a lovely face Plenty of room at the Hotel California Any time of year, you can find it here Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat. Some dance to remember, some dance to forget So I called up the Captain, 'Please bring me my wine' He said, 'We haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine' And still those voices are calling from far away, Wake you up in the middle of the night Just to hear them say... Welcome to the Hotel California Such a lovely place Such a lovely face They livin' it up at the Hotel California What a nice surprise, bring your alibis Mirrors on the ceiling, The pink champagne on ice And she said 'We are all just prisoners here, of our own device' And in the master's chambers, They gathered for the feast The stab it with their steely knives, But they just can't kill the beast Last thing I remember, I was Running for the door I had to find the passage back To the place I was before 'Relax,' said the night man, We are programmed to receive.

Lemon Tree- Fool's GardenI'm sitting here in a boring afternoonIt's just another raining sunday afternoonI'm wasting my time I got nothing to doI'm hanging around I'm waiting for youBut nothing ever happensAnd wonder I'm driving around in my car I'm driving too fast I'm driving too far I'd like to change my point of view I feel so lonely I'm waiting for you But nothing ever happens And I wonder I wonder how I wonder why Yesterday you told about the blue blue sky And all that I can see And all that I can see   Is just a yellow lemon tree   I'm turning my head up and dowm   I'm turning turning turning turning turning around  And all that I can see  Is just a yellow lemon tree I'm sitting here I miss the power I'd like to go out taking a shower But there's a heavey clound inside my head I feel so tired put myself into bed Where nothing ever happens And I wonder Isolation---is not good for me Isolation---I don't want to sit on a lemon tree I'm stepping around in a desert of jo Baby anyhow I'll get another toy And everything will happen And you'll wonder LEMON TREE Peter,Paul and Mary When I was just a lad of ten, my father said to me, "Come here and take a lesson from the lovely lemon tree. Don't put your trust in love, my boy." My father said to me. "I fear you'll find that love is like the lovely lemon tree. Lemon tree pretty and the lemon flower is sweet. But the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat. Beneath that lemon tree one day my love and I did lie. A girl so sweet that when she smile, the stars rose in the sky. We passed the summer lost in love, beneath the lemon tree. The music of her laughter hid my father's voice from me. Lemon tree pretty and the lemon flower is sweet. But the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat. One day she left without a word. She took away the sun. And in the dark she left behind, I knew what she had done. She left me for another. It's a common tale but ture. A sadder man, but wiser now. I sing this song to you. Lemon tree very pretty and the lemon flower is sweet. But the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat. Lemon tree pretty and the lemon flower is sweet. But the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat.

President Clinton Addresses Fortune Global Forum Delegates I am delighted to have the opportunity to join all of you today for the FORTUNE Global Forum in Shanghai. With nearly 500 CEOs from all around the world and many distinguished participants from China, this is truly an extra extraordinary gathering.     I was in Shanghai a little more than a year ago. I saw first-hand how th e oldest civilization on earth is becoming young again. It's impossible not to marvel at the extraordinary pace of change, or to see in Shanghai the tre mendous potential for China's future.     The U.S. sees China's continued economic growth as beneficial to our nat ion and to the world. China's progress ensures the well-being of nearly a quarter of the world's population. Its growing openness to the world can bring  better jobs, better pay, and greater prosperity to the American people as well. And it can contribute to the global store of knowledge and prosperity. That's why I believe it is vital to make China a full and constructive member of the international trading system. As I said to business leaders in Shanghai last July, and as all of you know well, China faces major challenges in advancing economic progress beyond the present point - including more restructuring of state-owned enterprises, developing a transparent legal and regulatory system, preserving the environment as the economy grows, and providing greater openness and accountability of its government and freedom of expression to its people. The United States is prepared to work with China in meeting all these challenges. The extraordinary group that is gathered for the FORTUNE Global Forum both reflects your confidence in China's future and will help assure this future will meet its great promise. Thank you for your efforts and I wish you every success in your meeting.
