The Unsinkable Molly Brown BILLY ZANE... Caledon Hockley BILL PAXTON... Brock Lovett Written and Directed by: JAMES CAMERON 1 BLACKNESS Then two faint lights appear, close together... growing brighter. They resolve into two DEEP SUBMERSIBLES, free-falling toward us like express elevators. One is ahead of the other, and passes close enough to FILL FRAME, looking like a spacecraft blazing with lights, bristling with insectile manipulators. TILTING DOWN to follow it as it descends away into the limitless blackness below. Soon they are fireflies, then stars. Then gone. CUT TO: 2 EXT./ INT. MIR ONE / NORTH ATLANTIC DEEP PUSHING IN on one of the falling submersibles, called MIR ONE, right up to its circular viewport to see the occupants. INSIDE, it is a cramped seven foot sphere, crammed with equipment. ANATOLY MIKAILAVICH, the sub's pilot, sits hunched over his controls... singing softly in Russian. Next to him on one side is BROCK LOVETT. He's in his late forties, deeply tanned, and likes to wear his Nomex suit unzipped to show the gold from famous shipwrecks covering his gray chest hair. He is a wiley, fast-talking treasure hunter, a salvage superstar who is part historian, par adventurer and part vacuum cleaner salesman. Right now, he is propped against the CO2 scrubber, fast asleep and snoring. On the other side, crammed into the remaining space is a bearded wide-body named LEWIS BODINE, sho is also asleep. Lewis is an R.O.V. (REMOTELY OPERATED VEHICLE) pilot and is the resident Titanic expert. Anatoly glances at the bottom sonar and makes a ballast adjustment. CUT TO: 3 EXT. THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA A pale, dead-flat lunar landscape. It gets brighter, lit from above, as MIR ONE enters FRAME and drops to the seafloor in a downblast from its thrusters. It hits bottom after its two hour free-fall with a loud BONK. CUT TO: 4 INT. MIR ONE Lovett and Bodine jerk awake at the landing. ANATOLY (heavy Russian accent) We are here. EXT. / INT. MIR ONE AND TWO 5 MINUTES LATER: THE TWO SUBS skim over the seafloor to the sound of sidescan sonar and the THRUM of big thrusters. 6 The featureless gray clay of the bottom unrols in the lights of the subs. Bodine is watching the sidescan sonar display, where the outline of a huge pointed object is visible. Anatoly lies prone, driving the sub, his face pressed to the center port. BODINE Come left a little. She's right in front of us, eighteen meters. Fifteen. Thirteen... you should see it. ANATOLY Do you see it? I don't see it... there! Out of the darkness, like a ghostly apparition, the bow of the ship appears. Its knife-edge prow is coming straight at us, seeming to plow the bottom sediment like ocean waves. It towers above the seafloor, standing just as it landed 84 years ago. THE TITANIC. Or what is left of her. Mir One goes up and over the bow railing, intact except for an overgrowth of Òrusticles" draping it like mutated Spanish moss. TIGHT ON THE EYEPIECE MONITOR of a video camcorder. Brock Lovett's face fills the BLACK AND WHITE FRAME. LOVETT It still gets me every time. The image pans to the front viewport, looking over Anatoly's shoulder, to the bow railing visible in the lights beyond. Anatoly turns. ANATOLY Is just your guilt because of estealing from the dead. CUT WIDER, to show that Brock is operating the camera himself, turning it in his hand so it points at his own face. LOVETT Thanks, Tolya. Work with me, here. Brock resumes his serious, pensive gaze out the front port, with the camera aimed at himself at arm's length. LOVETT It still gets me every time... to see the sad ruin of the great ship sitting here, where she landed at 2:30 in the morning, April 15, 1912, after her long fall from the world above. Anatoly rolls his eyes and mutters in Russian. Bodine chuckles and watches the sonar. BODINE You are so full of shit, boss. 7 Mir Two drives aft down the starboard side, past the huge anchor while Mir One passes over the seemingly endless forecastle deck, with its massive anchor chains still laid out in two neat rows, its bronze windlass caps gleaming. The 22 foot long subs are like white bugs next to the enormous wreck. LOVETT (V.O.) Dive nine. Here we are again on the deck of Titanic... two and a half miles down. The pressure is three tons per square inch, enough to crush us like a freight train going over an ant if our hull fails. These windows are nine inches thick and if they go, it's sayonara in two microseconds. 8 Mir Two lands on the boat deck, next to the ruins of the Officer's Quarters. Mir One lands on the roof of the deck hous nearby. LOVETT Right. Let's go to work. Bodine slips on a pair of 3-D electronic goggles, and grabs the joystick controls of the ROV. 9 OUTSIDE THE SUB, the ROV, a small orange and black robot called SNOOP DOG, lifts from its cradle and flies forward. BODINE (V.O.) Walkin? the dog. SNOOP DOG drives itself away from the sub, paying out its umbilical behind it like a robot yo-yo. Its twin stereo-video cameras swivel like insect eyes. The ROV descends through an open shaft that once was the beautiful First Class Grand Staircase. Snoop Dog goes down several decks, then moves laterally into the First Class Reception Room. SNOOP's VIDEO POV, moving through the cavernous interior. The remains of the ornate handcarved woodwork which gave the ship its elegance move through the floodlights, the lines blurred by slow dissolution and descending rusticle formations. Stalactites of rust hang down so that at times it looks like a natural grotto, then the scene shifts and the lines of a ghostly undersea mansion can be seen again. MONTAGE STYLE, as Snoop passes the ghostly images of Titanic's opulence: 10 A grand piano in amazingly good shape, crashed on its side against a wall. The keys gleam black and white in the lights. 11 A chandelier, still hanging from the ceiling by its wire... glinting as Snoop moves around it. 12 Its lights play across the floor, revealing a champagne bottle, then some WHITE STAR LINE china... a woman's high-top Ògranny shoe". Then something eerie: what looks like a child's skull resolves into the porcelain head of a doll. Snoop enters a corridor which is much better preserved. Here and there a door still hangs on its rusted hinges. An ornate piece of molding, a wall sconce... hint at the grandeur of the past. 13 THE ROV turns and goes through a black doorway, entering room B-52, the sitting room of a Òpromenade suite", one of the most luxurious staterooms on Titanic. BODINE I'm in the sitting room. Heading for bedroom B-54. LOVETT Stay off the floor. Don't stir it up like you did yesterday. BODINE I'm tryin? boss. Glinting in the lights are the brass fixtures of the near-perfectly preserved fireplace. An albino Galathea crab crawls over it. Nearby are the remains of a divan and a writing desk. The Dog crosses the ruins of the once elegant room oward another DOOR. It squeezes through the doorframe, scraping rust and wood chunks loose on both sides. It moves out of a cloud of rust and keeps on going. BODINE I'm crossing the bedroom. The remains of a pillared canopy bed. Broken chairs, a dresser. Through the collapsed wall of the bathroom, the porcelain commode and bathtub took almost new, gleaming in the dark. LOVETT Okay, I want to see what's under that wardrobe door. SEVERAL ANGLES as the ROV deploys its MANIPULATOR ARMS and starts moving debris aside. A lamp is lifted, its ceramic colors as bright as they were in 1912. LOVETT Easy, Lewis. Take it slow. Lewis grips a wardrobe door, lying at an angle in a corner, and pulls it with Snoop's gripper. It moves reluctantly in a cloud of silt. Under it is a dark object. The silt clears and Snoop's cameras show them what was under the door... BODINE Ooohh daddy-oh, are you seein? what I'm seein?? CLOSE ON LOVETT, watching his moniteors. By his expression it is like he is seeing the Holy Grail. LOVETT Oh baby baby baby. (grabs the mike) It's payday, boys. ON THE SCREEN, in the glare of the lights, is the object of their quest: a small STEEL COMBINATION SAFE. CUT TO: 14 EXT. STERN OF DECK OF KEDYSH - DAY THE SAFE, dripping wet in the afternoon sun, is lowered onto the deck of a ship by a winch cable. We are on the Russian research vessel AKADEMIK MISTISLAV KELDYSH. A crowd has gathered, including most of the crew of KELDYSH, the sub crews, and a hand-wringing money guy named BOBBY BUELL who represents the limited partners. There is also a documentary video crew, hired by Lovett to cover his moment of glory. Everyone crowds around the safe. In the background Mir Two is being lowered into its cradle on deck by a massive hydraulic arm. Mir One is already recovered with Lewis Bodine following Brock Lovett as he bounds over to the safe like a kid on Christman morning. BODINE Who's the best? Say it. LOVETT You are, Lewis. (to the video crew) You rolling? CAMERAMAN Rolling. Brock nods to his technicians, and they set about drilling the safe's hinges. During this operation, Brock amps the suspense, working the lens to fill the time. LOVETT Well, here it is, the moment of truth. Here's where we find out if the time, the sweat, the money spent to charter this ship and these subs, to come out here to the middle of the North Atlantic... were worth it. If what we think is in that same... is in that safe... it will be. Lovett grins wolfishly in anticipation of his greatest find yet. The door is pried loose. It clangs onto the deck. Lovett moves closer, peering into the safe's wet interior. A long moment then... his face says it all. LOVETT Shit. BODINE You know, boss, this happened to Geraldo and his career never recovered. LOVETT (to the video cameraman) Get that outta my face. CUT TO: 15 INT. LAB DECK, PRESERVATION ROOM - DAY Technicians are carefully removing some papers from the safe and placing them in a tray of water to separate them safely. Nearby, other artifacts from the stateroom are being washed and preserved. Buell is on the satellite phone with the INVESTORS. Lovett is yelling at the video crew. LOVETT You send out what I tell you when I tell you. I'm signing your paychecks, not 60 minutes. Now get set up for the uplink. Buell covers the phone and turns to Lovett. BUELL The partners want to know how it's going? LOVETT How it's going? It's going like a first date in prison, whattaya think?! Lovett grabs the phone from Buell and goes instantly smooth. LOVETT Hi, Dave? Barry? Look, it wasn't in the safe... no, look, don't worry about it, there're still plenty of places it could be... in the floor debris in the suite, in the mother's room, in the purser's safe on C deck... (seeing something) Hang on a second. A tech coaxes some letters in the water tray to one side with a tong... revealing a pencil (conte crayon) drawing of a woman. Brock looks closely at the drawing, which is in excellent shape, though its edges have partially disintegrated. The woman is beautiful, and beautifully rendered. In her late teens or early twenties, she is nude, though posed with a kind of casual modesty. She is on an Empire divan, in a pool of light that seems to radiate outward from her eyes. Scrawled in the lower right corner is the date: April 14 1912. And the initials JD. The girl is not entirely nude. At her throat is a diamond necklace with one large stone hanging in the center. Lovett grabs a reference photo from the clutter on the lab table. It is a period black-and-white photo of a diamond necklace on a black velvet jeller's display stand. He holds it next to the drawing. It is clearly the same piece... a complex setting with a massive central stone which is almost heart-shaped. LOVETT I'll be God damned. CUT TO: 16 INSERT A CNN NEWS STORY: a live satellite feed from the deck of the Keldysh, intercut with the CNN studio. ANNOUNCER Treasure hunter Brock Lovett is best known for finding Spanish gold in sunken galleons in the Caribbean. Now he is using deep submergence technology to work two and a half miles down at another famous wreck... the Titanic. He is with us live via satellite from a Russian research ship in the middle of the Atlantic... hello Brock? LOVETT Yes, hi, Tracy. You know, Titanic is not just A shipwrick, Titanic is THE shipwreck. It's the Mount Everest of shipwrecks. CUT TO: 17 INT. HOUSE / CERAMICS STUDIO PULL BACK from the screen, showing the CNN report playing on a TV set in the living room of a small rustic house. It is full of ceramics, figurines, folk art, the walls crammed with drawings and paintings... things collected over a lifetime. PANNING to show a glassed-in studio attached to the house. Outside it is a quiet morning in Ojai, California. In the studio, amid incredible clutter, an ANCIENT WOMAN is throwing a pot on a potter's wheel. The liquid red clay covers her hands... hands that are gnarled and age-spotted, but still surprisingly strong and supple. A woman in her early forties assists her. LOVETT (V.O.) I've planned this expedition for three years, and we're out here recovering some amazing things... things that will have enormous historical and educational value. CNN REPORTER (V.O.) But it's no secret that education is not your main purpose. You're a treasure hunter. So what is the treasure you're hunting? LOVETT (V.O.) I'd rather show you than tell you, and we think we're very close to doing just that. The old woman's name is ROSE CALVERT. Her face is a wrinkled mass, her body shapeless and shrunken under a one-piece African-print dress. But her eyes are just as bright and alive as those of a young girl. Rose gets up and walks into the living room, wiping pottery clay from her hands with a rag. A Pomeranian dog gets up and comes in with her. The younger soman, LIZZY CALVERT, rushes to help her. ROSE Turn that up please, dear. REPORTER (V.O.) Your expedition is at the center of a storm of controversy over salvage rights and even ethics. Many are calling you a grave robber. TIGHT ON THE SCREEN. LOVETT Nobody called the recovery of the artifacts from King Tut's tomb grave robbing. I have museum-trained experts here, making sure this stuff is preserved and catalogued properly. Look at this drawing, which was found today... The video camera pans off Brock to the drawing, in a tray of water. The image of the woman with the necklace FILLS FRAME. LOVETT ...a piece of paper that's been underwater for 84 years... and my team are able to preserve it intanct. Should this have remained unseen at the bottom of the ocean for eternity, when we can see it and enjoy it now...? ROSE is galvanized by this image. Her mouth hangs open in amazement. ROSE I'll be God damned. CUT TO: 18 EXT. KELDYSH DECK - NIGHT CUT TO KELDYSH. The Mir subs are being launched. Mir Two is already in the water, and Lovett is getting ready to climb into Mir One when Bobby Buell runs up to him. BUELL There's a satellite call for you. LOVETT Bobby, we're launching. See these submersibles here, going in the water? Take a message. BUELL No, trust me, you want to take this call. CUT TO: 19 INT. LAB DECK / KELDYSH - NIGHT Beull hands Lovett the phone, pushing down the blinking line. The call is from Rose and we see both ends of the conversation. She is in her kitchen with a mystified Lizzy. LOVETT This is Brock Lovett. What can I do for you, Mrs... ? BUELL Rose Calvert. LOVETT ... Mrs. Calvert? ROSE I was just wondering if you had found the "Heart of the Ocean" yet, Mr. Lovett. Brock almost drops the phone. Bobby sees his shocked expression... BUELL I told you you wanted to take this call. LOVETT (to Rose) Alright. You have my attention, Rose. Can you tell me who the woman in the picture is? ROSE Oh yes. The woman in the picture is me. CUT TO: 20 EXT. OCEAN - DAY SMASH CUT TO AN ENORMOUS SEA STALLION HELICOPTER thundering across the ocean. PAN 180 degrees as it roars past. There is no land at either horizon. The Keldysh is visible in the distance. CLOSE ON A WINDOW of the monster helicopter. Rose's face is visible, looking out calmly. CUT TO: 21 EXT. KELDYSH - DAY Brock and Bodine are watching Mir 2 being sweng over the side to start a dive. BODINE She's a goddamned liar! A nutcase. Like that... what's her name? That Anastasia babe. BUELL They're inbound. Brock nods and the three of them head forward to meet the approaching helo. BODINE She says she's Rose DeWitt Bukater, right? Rose DeWitt Bukater died on the Titanic. At the age of 17. If she'd've lived, she'd be over a hundred now. LOVETT A hundred and one next month. BODINE Okay, so she's a very old goddamned liar. I traced her as far back as the 20's... she was working as an actress in L.A. An actress. Her name was Rose Dawson. Then she married a guy named Calvert, moved to Cedar Rapids, had two kids. Now Calvert's dead, and from what I've heard Cedar Rapids is dead. The Sea Stallion approaches the ship, BG, forcing Brock to yell over the rotors. LOVETT And everyobody who knows about the diamond is supposed to be dead... or on this ship. But she knows about it. And I want to hear what she has to say. Got it? CUT TO: 22 EXT. KELDYSH HELIPAD IN A THUNDERING DOWNBLAST the helicopter's wheels bounce down on the helipad. Lovett, Buell and Bodine watch as the HELICOPTER CREW CHIEF hands out about ten suitcases, and then Rose is lowered to the deck in a wheelchair by Keldysh cewmen. Lizzy, ducking unnecessarily under the rotor, follows her out, carrying FREDDY the Pomeranian. The crew chief hands a puzzled Keldysh crewmember a goldfish bowl with several fish in it. Rose does not travel light. HOLD ON the incongruous image of this little old lady, looking impossibly fragile amongst all the high tech gear, grungy deck crew and gigantic equipment. BODINE Excuse me, I have to go check our supply of Depends. CUT TO: 23 INT. ROSE's STATEROOM / KELDYSH - DAY Lizzy is unpacking Rose's things in the small utilitarian room. Rose is placing a number of FRAMED PHOTOS on the bureau, arranging them carefully next to the fishbowl. Brock and Bodine are in the doorway. LOVETT Is your stateroom alright? ROSE Yes. Very nice. Have you met my granddaughter, Lizzy? She takes care of me. LIZZY Yes. We met just a few minutes ago, grandma. Remember, up on deck? ROSE Oh, yes. Brock glances at Bodine... oh oh. Bodine rolls his eyes. Rose finishes arranging her photographs. We get a general glimpse of them: the usual snapshots... children and grandchildren, her late husband. ROSE There, that's nice. I have to have my pictures when I travel. And Freddy of course. (to the Pomeranian) Isn't that right, sweetie. LOVETT Would you like anything? ROSE I should like to see my drawing. CUT TO: 24 INT. LAB DECK, PRESERVATION AREA Rose looks at the drawing in its tray of water, confronting herself across a soan of 84 years. Until they can figure out the best way to preserve it, they have to keep it immersed. It sways and ripples, almost as if alive. TIGHT ON Rose's ancient eyes, gazing at the drawing. 25 FLASHCUT of a man's hand, holding a conte crayon deftly creating a shoulder and the shape of her hair with two efficient lines. 26 THE WOMAN's FACE IN THE DRAWING, dancing under the water. 27 A FLASHCUT of a man's eyes, just visible over the top of a sketching pad. They look up suddenly right into the LENS. Soft eyes, but fearlessly direct. 28 Rose smiles, remembering. Brock has the reference photo of the necklace in his hand. LOVETT Louis the Sixteenth wore a fabulous stone, called the Blue Diamond of the Crown, which disappeared in 1792, about the time Louis lost everything from the neck up. The theory goes that the crown diamond was chopped too... recut into a heart-like shape... and it became Le Coeur de la Mer. The Heart of the Ocean. Today it would be worth more than the Hope Diamond. ROSE It was a dreadful, heavy thing. (she points at the drawing) I only wore it this once. LIZZY You actually believe this is you, grandma? ROSE It is me, dear. Wasn't I a hot number? LOVETT I tracked it down through insurance records... and old claim that was settled under terms of absolute secrecy. Do you know who the claiment was, Rost? ROSE Someone named Hockley, I should imagine. LOVETT Nathan Hockley, right. Pittsburgh steel tycoon. For a diamond necklace his son Caledon Hockley bought in France for his fiancee... you... a week before he sailed on Titanic. And the claim was filed right after the sinking. So the diamond had to've gone down with the ship. (to Lizzy) See the date? LIZZY April 14, 1912. LOVETT If your grandma is who she says she is, she was wearing the diamond the day Titanic sank. (MORE) LOVETT (CONT'd) (to Rose) And that makes you my new best friend. I will happily compensate you for anything you can tell us that will lead to its recovery. ROSE I don't want your money, Mr. Lovett. I know how hard it is for people who care greatly for money to give some away. BODINE (skeptical) You don't want anything? ROSE (indicating the drawing) You may give me this, if anything I tell you is of value. LOVETT Deal. (crossing the room) Over here are a few things we've recovered from your staterooms. Laid out on a worktable are fifty or so objects, from mundane to valuable. Rose, shrunken in her chair, can barely see over the tabletop. With a trembling hand she lifts a tortoise shell hand mirror, inlaid with mother of pearl. She caresses it wonderingly. ROSE This was mine. How extraordinary! It looks the same as the last time I saw it. She turns the mirror over and looks at her ancient face in the cracked glass. ROSE The reflection has changed a bit. She spies something else, a silver and moonstone art-nouveau brooch. ROSE My mother's brooch. She wanted to go back for it. Caused quite a fuss. Rose picks up an ornate art-nouveau HAIR COMB. A jade butterfly takes flight on the ebony handle of the comb. She turns it slowly, remembering. We can see that Rose is experiencing a rush of images and emotions that have lain dormant for eight decades as she handles the butterfly comb. LOVETT Are you ready to go back to Titanic? CUT TO: 29 INT. IMAGING SHACK / KELDYSH It is a darkened room lined with TV monitors. IMAGES OF THE WRECK fill the screens, fed from Mir One and Two, and the two ROVs, Snoop Dog and DUNCAN. BODINE Live from 12,000 feet. ROSE stares raptly at the screens. She is enthraled by one in particular, an image of the bow railing. It obviously means something to her. Brock is studying her reactions carefully. BODINE The bow's struck in the bottom like an axe, from the impact. Here... I can run a simulation we worked up on this monitor over here. Lizzy turns the chair so Rose can see the screen of Bodine's computer. As he is calling up the file, he keeps talking. BODINE We've put together the world's largest database on the Titanic. Okay, here... LOVETT Rose might not want to see this, Lewis. ROSE No, no. It's fine. I'm curious. Bodine starts a COMPUTER ANIMATED GRAPHIC on the screen, which parallels his rapid-fire narration. BODINE She hits the berg on the starboard side and it sort of bumps along... punching holes like a morse code... dit dit dit, down the side. Now she's flooding in the BODINE (cont'd) forward compartments... and the water spills over the tops of the bulkheads, going aft. As her bow is going down, her stern is coming up... slow at first... and then faster and faster until it's lifting all that weight, maybe 20 or 30 thousand tons... out of the water and the hull can't deal... so SKRTTT!! (making a sound in time with the animation) ... it splits! Right down to the keel, which acts like a big hinge. Now the bow swings down and the stern falls back level... but the weight of the bow pulls the stern up vertical, and then the bow section detaches, heading for the bottom. The stern bobs like a cork, floods and goes under about 2:20 a.m. Two hours and forty minutes after the collision. The animation then follows the bow section as it sinks. Rose watches this clinical dissection of the disaster without emotion. BODINE The bow pulls out of its dive and planes away, almost a half a mile, before it hits the bottom going maybe 12 miles an hour. KABOOM! The bow impacts, digging deeply into the bottom, the animation now follows the stern. BODINE The stern implodes as it sinks, from the pressure, and rips apart from the force of the current as it falls, landing like a big pile of junk. (indicating the simulation) Cool huh? ROSE Thank you for that fine forensic analysis, Mr. Bodine. Of course the experience of it was somewhat less clinical. LOVETT Will you share it with us? Her eyes go back to the screens, showing the sad ruins far below them. A VIEW from one of the subs TRACKING SLOWLY over the boat deck. Rose recognizes one of the Wellin davits, still in place. She hears ghostly waltz music. The faint and echoing sound of an officer's voice, English accented, calling ÒWomen and children only". 30 FLASH CUTS of screaming faces in a running crowd. Pandemonium and terror. People crying, praying, kneeling on the deck. Just impressions... flashes in the dark. 31 Rose Looks at another monitor. SNOOP DOG moving down a rusted, debris-filled corridor. Rose watches the endless row of doorways sliding past, like dark mouths. 32 IMAGE OF A CHILD, three years old, standing ankle deep in water in the middle of an endless corridor. The child is lost alone, crying. 33 Rose is shaken by the flood of memories and emotions. Her eyes well up and she puts her head down, sobbing quietly. LIZZY (taking the wheelchair) I'm taking her to rest. ROSE No! Her voice is surprisingly strong. The sweet little old lady is gone, replaced by a woman with eyes of steel. Lovett signals everyone to stay quiet. LOVETT Tell us, Rose. She looks from screen to screen, the images of the ruined ship. ROSE It's been 84 years... LOVETT Just tell us what you can-- ROSE (holds up her hand for silence) It's been84 years... and I can still smell the fresh paint. The china had never been used. The sheets had never been slept in. He switches on the minirecorder and sets it near her. ROSE Titanic was called the Ship of Dreams. And it was. It really was... As the underwater camera rises past the rusted bow rail, WE DISSOLVE / MATCH MOVE to that same railing in 1912... MATCH DISSOLVE: 34 EXT. SOUTHAMPTON DOCK - DAY SHOT CONTINUES IN A FLORIOUS REVEAL as the gleaming white superstructure of Titanic rises mountainously beyond the rail, and above that the buff-colored funnels stand against the sky like the pillars of a great temple. Crewmen move across the deck, dwarfed by the awesome scale of the steamer. Southanmpton, England, April 10, 1912. It is almost nnon on ailing day. A crowd of hundreds blackens the pier next to Titanic like ants on a jelly sandwich. IN FG a gorgeous burgundy RENAULT TOURING CAR swings into frame, hanging from a loading crane. It is lowered toward HATCH #2. On the pier horsedrawn vehicles, motorcars and lorries move slowly through the dense throng. The atmosphere is one of excitement and general giddiness. People embrace in tearful farewells, or wave and shout bon voyage wishes to friends and relatives on the decks above. A white RENAULT, leading a silver-gray DAIMLER-BENZ, pushes through the crowd leaving a wake in the press of people. Around the handsome cars people are streaming to board the ship, jostling with hustling seamen and stokers, porters, and barking WHITE STAR LINE officials. The Renault stops and the LIVERIED DRIVER scurries to open the door for a YOUNG WOMAN dressed in a stunning white and purple outfit, with an enormous feathered hat. She is 17 years old and beautiful, regal of bearing, with piercing eyes. It is the girl in the drawing. ROSE. She looks up at the ship, taking it in with cool appraisal. ROSE I don't see what all the fuss is about. It doesn't look any bigger than the Mauretania. A PERSONAL VALET opens the door on the other side of the car for CALEDON HOCKLEY, the 30 year old heir to the elder Hockley's fortune. ÒCal" is handsome, arrogant and rich beyond meaning. CAL You can be blase about some things, Rose, but not about Titanic. It's over a hundred feet longer than Mauretania, and far more luxurious. It has squash courts, a Parisian cafe... even Turkish baths. Cal turns and fives his hand to Rose's mother, RUTH DEWITT BUKATER, who descends from the touring car being him. Ruth is a 40ish society empress, from one of the most prominent Philadelphia families. She is a widow, and rules her household with iron will. CAL Your daughter is much too hard to impress, Ruth. (indicating a puddle) Mind your step. RUTH (gazing at the leviathan) So this is the ship they say is unsinkable. CAL It is unsinkable. God himself couldn't sink this ship. Cal speaks with the pride of a host providing a special experience. This entire entourage of rich Americans is impeccably turned out, a quintessential example of the Edwardian upper class, complete with servants. Cal's VALET, SPICER LOVEJOY, is a tall and impassive, dour as an undertaker. Behind him emerge TWO MAIDS, personal servants to Ruth and Rose.  WHITE STAR LINE PORTER scurries toward them, harried by last minute loading. PORTER Sir, you'll have to check your baggage through the main terminal, round that way-- Cal nonchalantly hands the man a fiver. The porter's eyes dilate. Five pounds was a monster tip in those days. CAL I put my faith in you, good sir. (MORE) CAL (CONT'd) (curtly, indicating Lovejoy) See my man. PORTER Yes, sir. My pleasure, sir. Cal never tires of the effect of money on the unwashed masses. LOVEJOY (to the porter) These trunks here, and 12 more in the Daimler. We'll have all this lot up in the rooms. The White Star man looks stricken when he sees the enormous pile of steamer trunks and suitcases loading down the second car, including wooden crates and steel safe. He whistles frantically for some cargo-handlers nearby who come running. Cal breezes on, leaving the minions to scramble. He quickly checks his pocket watch. CAL We'd better hurry. This way, ladies. He indicates the way toward the first class gangway. They move into the crowd. TRUDY BOLT, Rose's maid, hustles behind them, laden with bags of her mistress's most recent purchases... things too delicate for the baggage handlers. Cal leads, weaving between vehicles and handcarts, hurrying passengers (mostly second class and steerage) and well-wishers. Most of the first class passengers are avoiding the smelly press of the dockside crowd by using an elevated boarding bridge, twenty feet above. They pass a line of steerage passengers in their coarse wool and tweeds, queued up inside movable barriers like cattle in a chute. A HEALTH OFFICER examines their heads one by one, checking scalp and eyelashes for lice. They pass a well-dressed young man cranking the handle of a wooden Biograph inematograph" camera mounted on a tripod. NANIEL MARVIN (whose father founded the Biograph Film Studio) is filming his young bride in front of the Titanic. MARY MARVIN stands stiffly and smiles, self conscious. DANIEL Look up at the ship, darling, that's it. You're amazed! You can't believe how big it is! Like a mountain. That's great. Mary Marvin, without an acting fiber in her body, does a bad Clara Bow pantomime of awe, hands raised. Cal is jostled by two yelling steerage boys who shove past him. And he is bumped again a second later by the boys? father. CAL Steady!! MAN Sorry squire! The Cockney father pushes on, after his kids, shouting. CAL Steerage swine. Apparently missed his annual bath. RUTH Honestly, Cal, if you weren't forever booking everything at the last instant, we could have gone through the terminal instead of running along the dock like some squalid immigrant family. CAL All part of my charm, Ruth. At any rate, it was my darling fiancee's beauty rituals which made us late. ROSE You told me to change. CAL I couldn't let you wear black on sailing day, sweetpea. It's bad luck. ROSE I felt like black. Cal guides them out of the path of a horse-drawn wagon loaded down with two tons of OXFORD MARMALADE, in wooden cases, for Titanic's Victualling Department. CAL Here I've pulled every string I could to book us on the grandest ship in history, in her most luxurious suites... and you act as if you're going to your execution. Rose looks up as the hull of Titanic looms over them...a great iron wall, Bible black and sever. Cal motions her forward, and she enters the gangway to the D Deck doors with a sense of overwhelming dread. OLD ROSE (V.O.) It was the ship of dreams... to everyone else. To me it was a slave ship, taking me back to America in chains. CLOSE ON CAL's HAND IN SLOW-MOTION as it closes possessively over Rose's arm. He escorts her up the gangway and the black hull of Titanic swallows them. OLD ROSE (V.O.) Outwardly I was everything a well brought up girl should be. Inside, I was screaming. 35 CUT TO a SCREAMING BLAST from the mighty triple steam horns on Titanic's funnels, bellowing their departure warning. CUT TO: 36 EXT. SOUTHAMPTON DOCKS / TITANIC - DAY A VIEW OF TITANIC from several blocks away, towering above the terminal buildings like the skyline of a city. The steamer's whistle echoes across Southampton. PULL BACK, revealing that we were looking through a window, and back further to show the smoky inside of a pub. It is crowded with dockworkers and ship;s crew. Just inside the window, a poker game is in progress. FOUR MEN, in working class clothes, play a very serious hand. JACK DAWSON and FABRIZIO DE ROSSI, both about 20, exchange a glance as the other two players argue in Swedish. Jack is American, a lanky drifter with his hair a little long for the standards of the times. He is also unshaven, and his clothes are rumpled from sleeping in them. He is an artist, and has adopted the bohemian style of art scene in Paris. He is also very self-possessed and sure-footed for 20, having lived on his own since 15. The TWO SWEDES continue their sullen argument, in Swedish. OLAF (subtitled) You stupid fishhead. I can't believe you bet our tickets. SVEN (subtitled) You lost our money. I'm just trying to get it back. Now shutup and take a card. JACK (jaunty) Hit me again, Sven. Jack takes the card and slips it into his hand. ECU JACK's EYES. They betray nothing. CLOSE ON FABRIZIO licking his lips nervously as he refuses a card. ECU STACK in the middle of the table. Bills and coins from four counrties. This has been going on for a while. Sitting on top of the money are two 3RD CLASS TICKETS for RMS TITANIC. The Titanic's whistle blows again. Final warning. JACK The moment of truth boys. Somebody's life's about to change. Fabrizio puts his cards down. So do the Swedes. Jack holds his close. JACK Let's see... Fabrizio's got niente. Olaf, you've got squat. Sven, uh oh... two pair... mmm. (turns to his friend) Sorry Fabrizio. FABRIZIO What sorry? What you got? You lose my money?? Ma va faÕn culo testa di cazzo-- JACK Sorry, you're not gonna see your mama again for a long time... He slaps a full house down on the table. JACK (grinning) 'Cause you're goin? to America!! Full house boys! FABRIZIO Porca Madonna!! YEEAAAAA!!! The table explodes into shouting in several languages. Jack rakes in the money and the tickets. JACK (to the Swedes) Sorry boys. Three of a kind and a pair. I'm high and you're dry and... (to Fabrizio) ... we're going to-- FABRIZIO/JACK AMERICA!!! Olaf balls up one huge farmer's fist. We think he's going to clobber Jack, but he swings round and punches Sven, who flops backward onto the floor and sits there, looking depressed. Olaf forgets about Jack and Fabrizio, who are dancing around, and goes into a rapid harangue of his stupid cousin. Jack kisses the tickets, then jumps on Fabrizio's back and rides him around the pub. It's like they won the lottery. JACK Goin? home... to the land o? the free and the home of the real hot-dogs! On the TITANIC!! We're ridin? in high style now! We're practically goddamned royalty, ragazzo mio!! FABRIZIO You see? Is my destinio!! Like I told you. I go to America!! To be a millionaire!! (MORE) FABRIZIO (CONT'd) (to pubkeeper) Capito?? I go to America!! PUBKEEPER No, mate. Titanic go to America. In five minutes. JACK Shit!! Come on, Fabri! (grabbing their stuff) Come on!! (to all, grinning) It's been grand. They run for the door. PUBKEEPER 'Course I'm sure if they knew it was you lot comin?, they'd be pleased to wait! CUT TO: 37 OMITTED 38 EXT. TERMINAL - TITANIC Jack and Fabrizio, carrying everything they own in the world in the kit bags on their shoulders, sprint toward the pier. They tear through milling crowds next to the terminal. Shouts go up behind them as they jostle slow-moving gentlemen. They dodge piles of luggage, and weave through groups of people. They burst out onto the pier and Jack comes to a dead stop... staring at the cast wall of the ship's hull, towering seven stories above the wharf and over an eighth of a mile long. The Titanic is monFADE IN:EXT. NEAR THE GERMAN FRONT - 180 A.D. - DAWNThe rising sun unveils steep hills and luxuriant mountains untouched by man. Snow flurries dart in the frigid air and on the horizon ROWS gather.EXT. DIRT ROADA column of Praetorian Cavalry flank two enclosed wagons as they rattle along a rock and log accordion road. On all sides a forest rises like some kind of primordial soul: limitless and dark. With every step 'steam' whooshes from the nostrils of the horses.The first wagon halts as a Praetorian Guard jogs back. He straightens his tunic and helmet and raps on the wooden door as the second wagon stops behind. The door swings aside and another Praetorian Guard leans out.1ST PRAETORIAN GUARDSir, we must be getting near.INT. FIRST WAGONLUCIUS AELIUS AURELIUS COMMODUS huddles in the back of the wagon: Dark hair, handsome, beard; as Commodus rises we see he's a large, powerfully built young man and though barely twenty years old he already has the caution and arrogance of a Caesar.Opposite A GAUNT MAN climbs from a heap of blankets:GALEN of PERGAMUM, probably the most frozen, unhappy manon earth. The wagon is lined with pillows and blankets.Baskets of bread and dried fruit are stacked in one corner and an oil lamp hangs from a pivoting cleat like the swinging lamp in a ship.2ND PRAETORIAN GUARDCaesar, we're nearly there.EXT. WAGONCommodus steps down and pulls his cape up against the bitter cold. Galen follows, curiously overcoming his natural hatred of discomfort. TRIBUUS, burly Praetorian Guard commander salutes Commodus and leads him to the edge of a gully. Tribuus is an old-timer for whom Commodus is just another royal pain-in-the-ass.THE GULLY IS BLACK WITH CROWS -- with their endless CAW- CAW-CAW" they feast on corpses and in the shadows below ROMAN SOLDIERS bury dead comrades. Compared with the burnished perfection of the Praetorian Guards these typical infantry grunts are grizzled and battered.COMMODUSSoldier! What happened here! A legionnaire stops working, spits, leans on his shovel so he can shout up toward Tribuus and Commodus. Galen squats beside a corpse, fascinated.LEGIONNAIRE We had a battle! COMMODUS I can see that. You leave your dead on the field? LEGIONNAIRE General Narcissus beat the Germans here and now the whole army is moving fast! No time to let them get away! THE SECOND WAGON -- as a twenty-five year old ATTRACTIVE YOUNG WOMAN opens the door. She is LUCI LLA -- Commodus' sister. Lucilla pulls her coat tight against the wind. LUCILLA Where are we now, Commodus? Can you see the camp? My Gods! The air is turning into ice!COMMODUSWe're nearly there, Lucilla. LUCILLA That's what you told me two days ago! COMMODUS Will you please get back in your wagon? And stay there? LUCILLA I'm tired of being stuck in that wagon. Embarrassed by Commodus' childish spat with is sister, Tribuus gestures to the 2nd Praetorian. TRIBUUS Soldier, help the Emperor's sister. As a soldier jogs back up toward Lucilla Commodus looks down at the legionnaire leaning on his shovel. COMMODUS Where is my father? TRIBUUS Where is the emperor and the army, soldier? The legionnaire points up the road. Commodus and Tribuus return to the wagon. Galen rolls the dead soldier over and sticks his finger  into a gaping chest wound, then notices the legionnaire glaring at him. GALEN I'm a doctor. The legionnaire studies him a second, then the corpse as if giving a second  opinion. LEGIONNAIRE Well, you're too late. Galen pulls back in revulsion at his impudence. He scrambles to follow Commo dus. The legionnaire spits and gets back to work. EXT. DIRT ROAD - DAWN The wagon crests a hill with a precipitous view of the valley and torches that seem to fill the lingering dark far below. The wagon makes straight for them. AND COMMODUS... Riding on a seat on the front of the wagon, wrapped to his chin in a bearskin blanket -- absolutely set on catching up with the army. EXT. GERMAN FRONT - VINDOBONA - 182 A.D. - NIGHT  On the edge of a forest sixty year old EMPEROR MARCUS AURELIUS stands in the back of an unharnessed supply wagon surrounded by a dark so black it's barely moved by blazing torches. A WOLF -- living symbol of Rome -- stand before the wagon held on a leash by a battle-hardened SENIOR CENTURION: SERVIS. Marcus wears the purple robe of imperial power over his leather and copper segmented upper body armor (LORICA SEGMENTATA). His breath clouds in the bitter cold; the man is tired to the bone. OPPOSITE STANDS THE ROMAN ARMY This is the mighty army of the Danube, yet it seems like these men -- buried  in the shadows and as frozen and worn as their leader -- have come to the very edge of the world to be swallowed by this wilderness. NUMIDIAN ARCHERS, tall Africans, out of place in this freezing land, stand behind their leader -- JUBA -- who has the whip-like body of a dancer. Each carries his recurve bow as if it were a delicate musical instrument.Quivers of brightly colored arrows hang from their backs.Field commanders -- CONTUBERNIUM -- stand by each row ofsoldiers. Less numerous, and above the Contubernium, are the CENTURIONS, and at the front line of the mass of cohorts are four TRIBUNES.BEFORE THE ENTIRE ARMYmounted on magnificent grey horses, are two LEGATE, the overall commanding generals, wearing ornate lorica segmentata. The first Legatus is QUINTUS CLARUS, Rome Army General: fair-haired, fit, forty. He has the face of a boy.The second is NARCISSUS MERIDAS, General, Spanish GeminaFelix VII Army: dark hair, proud and though about Quintus' age his face is like a map of a soldiers's hard life. Narcissus' eyes are locked on Marcus like the eyes of a long-suffering pilgrim on the icon of his single hope.THE WAGONJust before Marcus is about to speak, Commodus steps into the wagon looking out of breath. Surprised, Marcus embraces him and then Commodus stands behind his father wrapped tightly in his bearskin robe. He's trying to look tough but unlike his father he's not used to this rigorous life.NARCISSUS & QUINTUSswap looks as if Commodus were the last person they were expecting...MARCUS AURELIUSCitizens!Marcus' voice booms out tough and firm as if defying the cold and dark.MARCUS AURELIUSToday may be the last day in the life of Rome... For nine hundredyears Rome has lived! For nine hundred years architects, mathematicians, poets, and philosophers have fled within her arms sheltered from superstition, prejudice, hate, and every form ofhuman cruelty. We Romans have become a light in the barbariannight!ON NARCISSUSNo trace of feeling, just his breath slowly clouding in the frigid air.AND MARCUS...Seeming to look at each legionnaire as he speaks.MARCUS AURELIUSFor nine hundred years this one heart of humankind has been defended by the likes of Pompeii, Mark Anthony, Julius Caesar, The Divine Augustus, Claudius, Trajan, Hadrian, and my own father Antoninus Pius. Now, it has come down to us!It has come down to this one day...He leans forward on the rail of the wagon, a gesture that seems to bring him closer to the men.MARCUS AURELIUSFive years we've lived together, you and I, in a state of total war. Wehave shared cold, rain, heat, bitterly watched the deaths of beloved friends. We are not alone. Look around you! Consuls and Senators have forsworn the luxuries of home and moved with us to the front to ensure that the administration of our government radiates from the source of her bravest citizens.OUTSIDE A FIELD TENTStand SENATOR GAIUS and SENATOR FALCO wrapped to theirchins against the staggering cold.Both men are in advanced middle age. Gaius looks like a stoic: impassive, plainly dressed. Falco wears an expensive fur trimmed robe with gold and asbestos.Flanking them are CONSULS and various OFFICIALS. Lucillastands by Gaius and a very stately, attractive NUMIDIAN WOMAN, MELA, Juba's wife.MARCUS AURELIUS (O.S.)The link between us and Rome is a solid chain of unbroken purpose!For nine hundred years the Roman Senate has stood one with the army in dignity and resolve!AND COMMODUS...watching the troops, seeming to weigh any response with the utmost calculation.AND MARCUSeyes dead-ahead on the troops.MARCUS AURELIUSBut on this day I ask you to put those nine centuries down -- they'retoo heavy for us to carry into battle again! So, we'll leave themhere for the Senators to guard for us!QUINTUSallows himself a smile as the troops grin and laugh. He looks across at Narcissus who manages the faintest of smiles -- a very serious man...MARCUS AURELIUSThis day I want you to fight for the cold and the heat and the filth --and for all those friends who will never feel the sun on their facesagain! I want you to fight for you!For at the moment of battle you and you alone are Rome!THE SOLDIERS...Rank after disciplined rank: not one sideways look, not one sound...AND MARCUS...As his eyes pass from cohort to cohort.MARCUS AURELIUSHow quickly all things sordid and perishable in the universe disappear. Yet throughout time the remembrance of great deeds grows only fresher bringing life again to those who dare perform them...(pause)Legate Narcissus Meridas and Legate Quintus Clarus, I must ask you and your legions for one more day out of nine centuries! Will you give it to me?The troops HOWL their support. Marcus pulls his sword and half turns aiming it behind him.MARCUS AURELIUSThere is the enemy of Rome!Commodus steps forward to join his father and the uproar grows.NARCISSUSremoves his helmet as a sign of respect. Now the stoic veneer of his face cracks into a mixture of reverence and perhaps even love for the emperor.AND COMMODUS...taking every single bit of this in. He seems particularly interested in Narcissus.NARCISSUS & QUINTUSMove their horses close and dismount.QUINTUSI see the emperor's little boy has finally caught up with the army.NARCISSUSLet's hope he doesn't start giving orders.Servis approaches and salutes. It starts to RAIN.SERVISAt your command, sir.EXT. FOREST - EARLY MORNINGIn a howling RAINSTORM Felix Division breaks through thedense woods like a moving human wall behind their rectangular shields.They're in the midst of MASS COMBAT -- spears, arrows andstones crash off shields, taking out soldiers.The ZING of arrows and WHOOSH of spears saturate the air.Because there are no explosives EVERY SCREAM and ARROWSHOT is HEARD.NARCISSUSleads his troops on foot in the thick of battle. ACONTUBERNIUM walks beside Narcissus tugged on by theleashed WOLF MASCOT as painted GERMAN WARRIORS dart out of the woods hurling spears. NARCISSUS YELLS OVER THE SOUNDS OF BATTLE, WIND AND RAIN.NARCISSUSTribune! The right flank is falling back! If we lose the flank we'reall dead!The Tribune salutes and dashes off and Servis rushes in from another direction.SERVISSir! There's a fortification ahead!The Germans are waiting for us!Should we slow the men down?AHEADJuba leads his Numidians in  fluid, disorderly formationinto the thickest part of the forest. Just before he dodges into the woods Juba locks eyes with Narcissus -- and he's GONE.NARCISSUS --jerks his shield up in time to stop an ARROW. But aLEGIONNAIRE is SLAMMED IN THE CHEST by another as sniper- shots whiz in.Now, from the distance comes the rolling roar of DRUMS andHOWLS. Then a horrendous THUNDERCLAP and a bolt oflightning tears the lead grey sky.NARCISSUSCome on, Servis! Forward!Servis turns and runs down the front line as the storm becomes more intense. The YELLING and DRUMMING getLOUDER...THE GERMAN FORTIFICATIONA chaos of interlocked logs rimmed at the top withsharpened stakes. GERMAN WARRIORS SHOUT WAVING SPEARSAND CLUBS.THE FELIX DIVISIONscatters the German snipers and rearguard before it,closing on the fortification.TRIBUNEWhere the hell are the damned archers?NARCISSUSDon't worry about Juba; just keep our own damned troops moving!German warriors loose an avalanche of rocks and spears.NARCISSUSTortoise!TRIBUNETortoise! Form a tortoise!As the call echoes legionnaires furiously overlap their shields on all sides and overhead forming a perfect BOXjust as the stones and spears crash against them...INSIDE THE TORTOISErocks slam the wall of interlocked shields with ear- splitting resonance. But the tortoise holds.OUTSIDEsoon as the barrage stops the Germans unleash FIGHTINGMASTIFFS. The dogs tear into the legionnaires. One leapsat Narcissus and he kills it with a single chop of his Spatha sword.SERVISHere they come!German warriors charge the shields as the legionnaires level their spears. Singing and screaming the warriorsIMPALE THEMSELVES ON THE SPEARS and grasp the shafts. ASECOND WAVE charges the line on the heels of the first.THE LEGIONNAIRES --In a well rehearsed movement twist their spears releasing the tips. As the dying warriors drop with the quick- release spear tips embedded in their bodies, the Romans reverse their spears over the top and -- no problem:Roman spears have points on BOTH ENDS. So the German second wave is met by an intact position.Still they power into the line chopping at the Romanshields with axes.FAR BEHIND...a legionnaire blows a piercing note on a brass horn and a second, thin line of legionnaires APPEARS OUT OF THEFOREST. Narcissus turns, yelling to a contubernium behindhim.NARCISSUSnswer that signal!A red 'flag' on a long pole goes up answering the trumpet, and the line of the fresh cohort parts in segments revealing ONAGERS -- portable catapults -- and SCORPIONS -- powerful precision-fire crossbows that launch javelins.THE ARTILLERY FIRES...cannonball-size shot driven at a hundred miles an hour rip over the heads of Narcissus' troopers and slam against the fort walls.ONAGER CREWSreload with incredible speed from wagons filled with hand-picked rocks -- some bear SCRAWLED EPITHETS essentiallythe Latin equivalent of "EAT THIS HANS!" Onagers launchbarrage after barrage, their backs leaping off the ground like recoiling 45 millimeter field guns.SCORPION OPERATORSpicks their targets. The Germans are leveled by a sheet of scorpion javelins as their crude log fortification splinters under the onager barrage. The Germans are being pulverized by superior technology.THE WHOLE GERMAN ARMY --led by tall GREY BEARDED MAN, pours from the log blockadeand hurls itself against the Roman line.Again the Romans are staggered as the Germans collapse more of their shields, battering through the front line with clubs and axes.NARCISSUS --fights desperately refusing to give ground. A German rears up from behind and slams Narcissus in the back with a club and HE GOES DOWN.Narcissus is nearly trampled as another GERMAN WARRIORthrows himself on Narcissus holding his sword arm about tokill him with a club -- there's a blur of fur and blood asthe ROMAN WOLF LEAPS INTO THE WARRIOR'S FACE.Narcissus lurches back to his feet and seeing he's in themidst of the whole German army he goes wild. Yelling andslashing out with his sword and the knife-edge top of hisshield, in seconds he's drenched with blood.LIKE SOME FANTASTIC ROMANTIC PAINTING --Narcissus climbs onto a HEAP OF BODIES flashing his swordwith the snarling Wolf of Rome at his side.CENTURIONS AND LEGIONNAIRES --see this supernatural vision of their leader battling for life --SERVISRomulus! The gods of Rome arefighting with general Narcissus!Others join the cry as more legionnaires turn and there'san irresistible surge of the army back toward Narcissus.NARCISSUSjoined by Servis, then another, then two Contubernium,then ten legionnaires... the legionnaires fight desperately to hold their ground around Narcissus.Then with a sound of a hundred out-of-tune violins theGermans are SWEPT FROM BEHIND BY ARROWS.JUBA'S NUMIDIANSline the edge of the forest four deep pouring arrows intothe Germans. Juba stands on a log in front shoutingPIERCING SING-SONG ORDERS easily heard over the screams ofbattle.NARCISSUS & HIS TROOPSDIVE behind their shields for cover from the cloudburst of arrows.Arrows fired by almighty recurve bows hit the Germans with the power of .44 magnum rounds: arms splinter like twigs; shields are nailed to chests; skulls explode.The Germans turn and charge the Numidians but they may aswell hurl themselves against a machine gun nest as they'remowed-down in whole lines. They hurtle back in disorder into the forest.THE ROMANSlower their shields. Narcissus catches a fast smile from Juba, then jumps to his feet...NARCISSUSCome on men! Forward!RIVER BANKThe retreating German army spills out of the forest following their leader into a shallow narrows, Narcissus and his division on their heels.ABOVEon the opposite bank is a single Roman on horse back.It's Quintus. He draws his sword and spurs ahead -- then right behind him rush his fresh ROME COHORTS.THE TWO ROMAN ARMIES --crash into the Germans in the middle of the river -- throwing aside his shield and holding his sword with two hands Narcissus chops his way into the enemy with a fury.Wild chaos of horrendous fighting in knee-deep water -- spray, blood, flashing swords and flying spears as men desperately kill to stay alive.Then the two Roman armies close like a fist and the surviving Germans squeeze through the fingers in disarray.NARCISSUS & QUINTUSmeet in the middle of the river and at that moment the legionnaires realize they've won. They howl and stab at the heavens with their swords to intimidate the gods.Narcissus pulls off his lorica segmentata which literally drools blood and heaves it into the water. Then in the vortex of the cheering cohorts, he and Quintus embrace.FROM ABOVEThe Danube runs RED...EXT. ROMAN CAMP - VINDOBONA - NEAR DUSKSurrounded by cheering legions Narcissus rides his greyhorse slowly into camp. Servis walks ahead leading the beloved wolf mascot on a leash. Quintus rides beside Narcissus, but it's clear all this adulation is forNarcissus.Narcissus dismounts and finally the crowd parts revealingCommodus outside the Roman headquarters flanked by slavesand Praetorian Guard. Commodus strides forward and embraces him as a cheer goes up from the soldiers.COMMODUSWelcome back from your great triumph Narcissus Meridas. My father sends his heart felt praise. Sadly, Marcus is in dark humors -- nothingto worry about, but he needs rest.Likely just the weather.NARCISSUSRespectfully Caesar, Quintus and I must report.COMMODUSOf course, but not now. However, if he continues to be unwell, you may report to me.A challenging look from Commodus -- clearly Narcissus is not in the mood to report to this boy. Quintus steps in.QUINTUSGladly, Caesar. And, if you'd like we can take you for a tour of thefront at first light.COMMODUSI'm certain father will be in better humors by then. Now, honor us with your presence at dinner. I'll join you as soon as I see my father'sphysician.For a second Commodus eyes the shouting army... it makes him NERVOUS. Then he turns to enter the building.NARCISSUSWhat the hell was all that about?QUINTUSWhat the hell do you think it was about? There's nothing an unprovedheir to the throne likes less than glaring competence in others.NARCISSUSWhy don't we try to keep politics out of the conversation.QUINTUSWell, we can try...INT. ROMAN HQ - EARLY MORNINGInside the single large building at the Vindobona central base, a wraith-like FORTUNE TELLER stands with her eyes closed, hand on Falco's head.TRIBUNES and high ranking HANGERS-ON bask near a blazinghearth like over-fed dogs. Senator Gaius sits apart near Juba and his wife Mela. All are fixated on Falco.FORTUNE TELLER... a great man: great of birth -- great of girth!(laughs all around)Your fate in flame and bronze is wrought... the rest in haze is sought.FALCOSmoke from the fire no doubt!She opens her eyes and Falco hands her a coin.NARCISSUSFire and bronze -- symbols of strong character, Senator!All turn toward Narcissus and Quintus.FALCOGeneral Narcissus, it's your turn!Everyone in this room would love to know your future. Go on, ask him if he'll stand for the Senate!Applause as Narcissus catches a smirk from Quintus.NARCISSUSNo future-telling, please, I've been terrified enough for one day.LUCILLANarcissus! Terrified? You? The only thing he's scared of is me.Lucilla greets Narcissus with an embarrassingly intimate embrace. Looks like she's been hitting the sauce pretty good.GAIUSSlave! Wine and meat for our generals! The saviors of Rome!FALCOJudging from your adoring troops and what we heard, Narcissus, you are personally responsible for our victory.Lucilla hangs onto Narcissus' hand taking him around the room like he was her date.LUCILLAYou know our two most senior Senators: Gaius Cantus and FalcoVerus?NARCISSUSOnly from a distance.GAIUSWell let's not be so distant, general. Now that this war is ending Rome needs good men off the battlefield as well.JUBAThe Wolf of Rome fought beside him.I saw it with my own eyes.Narcissus looks at Juba as if to say 'thanks a lot.'LUCILLAYou see? The Gods favor you for greatness! Tell us about it -- allabout it.VOICESYes/Tell us/Tell all!NARCISSUSThe truth is I got into a little trouble and when the army came torescue me the German counterattack broke around us. An example ofbeing in precisely the wrong place at exactly the right time.(off their laughs)It was Juba and his archers who finally got them running. ThenQuintus arrived with the Rome legions just in time to cut off their retreat.Commodus and Galen suddenly step into the light; it'sunclear how long Commodus may have been listening in thedoorway. Everyone rises...COMMODUSNarcissus Meridas, you win the battle and deny you had any hand itit. But if we had lost, you would have taken complete responsibility.Senators, Rome needs more such models of humility and courage.(pause)My father sends regrets that he will not join us after all as he continues to be unwell.Commodus reaches over to fill Lucilla's cup which is nearly brimming.COMMODUSMore wine, sister? Surely you can drink more than that.LUCILLAI was suddenly thinking about going to bed.COMMODUSOh, stay...(that was an order)Don't you want to join the chorus of praises for Narcissus' glory? Just remember, he is a married man.NARCISSUSDo you expect Marcus to be well enough by morning for an udience?COMMODUSThat's difficult to say, general.NARCISSUSPerhaps, Master Galen, you may say.GALENIt's difficult to name a time...COMMODUSMay I remind everyone that MasterGalen is the finest medical philosopher in the Empire and his detailed assessment of the Emperor is delicate and confidential and isthe business of the immediate family alone.NARCISSUSI would venture, with all respect: the Emperor's health is the businessof every soul in the empire.GAIUSYes! The days of Imperial Prerogative and disdain for the Senate are over -- thanks to your father! Now report to the Senate, Master Galen: what is Marcus' state?COMMODUSReport, Master Galen, by all means.The Senate demands it...GALENWe are talking simply about a disturbance of the hues. Nothingmore. In precisely one hour I will analyze the Emperor's bile and thenmy assistants and I will stand by in an unfailing vigil until his feverbreaks. Now with your permission Caesar, Senators? I must return tomy patient.Commodus gestures him out as if he were just amused.COMMODUSOne doctor now knows his place in the empire. Congratulations,general, your victory seems to inspire courage everywhere.Quintus stops flirting with Lucilla's slaves and starts paying close attention to the developing dynamics.NARCISSUSThe battle was won, today, and Iprefer to believe it was a gift ofJanus, the eldest God of Rome. Godof my ancestors.FALCOGod of passages and changes?NARCISSUSI believe we are arriving in an enlightened age; an age of peacethat will bring Rome her greatest glory. Thanks to Marcus Aurelius.FALCOYou know, general, there is a Gate of Janus in Rome which is onlyclosed in time of peace. Sadly, it has remained open for three hundred years.NARCISSUSI've read of it.FALCOBut have never been?NARCISSUSMy only visits to Rome, Senator, have been through books. But thewar's over, time to close the door of war once and for all.COMMODUSThen you'd be out of a job.NARCISSUSGladly Caesar.COMMODUSOr perhaps into a new one. But here's to your God and the courageof our legions...GAIUSAnd the man who gives them this extraordinary courage.Gaius stands and raises his cup. But Quintus is amused tosee him get as close to Narcissus as he can -- nearly hiding behind him.COMMODUSQuite so. Narcissus and his courageous men; may they live longto serve Rome...LUCILLAAnd Caesar! Let's not forget to serve Caesar!Falco in turn moves to stand near Commodus.FALCOThey are one and the same my lady.Which is why we senior Senators have chosen to be here on the front to share the hardships of our courageous Emperor -- MarcusAurelius and his son -- may the gods protect them!LUCILLAOh, yes, my father is a raving genius -- poet, essayist, philosopher, warrior... It's a wonder he doesn't drift off like a cloud he's so damned ethereal.'Marcus Aurelius Etherealus'... But he should cast his divine eyesearthward once in a while and see how fallible some of his decisionshave been! Of course I don't mean you, Commodus -- gods know you're perfect. As far as sharing in his glory and suffering -- well, Icertainly didn't want to be here.Isn't that true, darling brother?Commodus, I believe, was afraid that if I stayed in Rome I might foment a rebellion! Seize power for myself!Commodus glares at Lucilla as she trails off in laughter.Mela decides it's time to rescue Lucilla from herself.She rises and crosses to sit beside her.MELAIf you men are going to talk politics leave us out of it.JUBAShe's not so bashful about politics when we're alone.MELAOnly when it concerns Numidia. And, we're far from home so I'll play the good Roman woman and listen -- perhaps Lucilla we could play that part together.COMMODUSWhat do you say, Narcissus? Where are you in this great new balancebetween the Emperor or the Senate?GAIUSAre you for the Senate, Narcissus Meridas? Or do you back theemperor?NARCISSUSI back Rome against all her enemies -- if that answer disappoints you,I'm not a politician...COMMODUSOh, but with the army behind you, you could become extremelypolitical. Not a Republican by any chance?FALCOBe as brave here as you are on the battlefield...QUINTUSIn the presence of such fearless senators there's little need for loyal soldiers to speculate on politics.COMMODUSAh, Quintus famous for his perfect timing. But we want to know whatthe hero of the Danube thinks.Dead silence. Every face in the room turns to Narcissus.NARCISSUSA republican is a man who strives to create equality among all classes. At the core he's a man who believes in doing what's right.GAIUSThe trouble is defining exactly what 'right' is.NARCISSUSWe all know what right is, Senator.COMMODUSI would say there's nothing more dangerous than a man who knows what 'right' is.NARCISSUSThe dangerous man, Caesar, is the man who doesn't care.Stony silence. A SLAVE enters.SLAVEThe emperor is awake. He asks to see his generals.INT. MARCUS AURELIUS' ROOM - LATERMarcus Aurelius sits up in his bed and watches with a seasoned campaigner's eye as Narcissus and Quintus lean over a large, beautifully hand-drawn map. Commodus sits by his side, the attentive son.NARCISSUSFelix Army controls the narrows.Four cohorts from Quintus' legion hold the opposite shore and once we repair the German fort we'll be able to reinforce and supply them at will.Seeing he's having trouble seeing, Narcissus holds the map up for him.MARCUS AURELIUSCan the Germans cross up stream on boats or float bridges?QUINTUSNot through those rapids. They're disorganized and their army barelyexists.NARCISSUSBut they're not destroyed, not yet.COMMODUSDo we really need to repair this fort? It seems like an expensiveundertaking. I propose we burn it to the ground. That way if theGermans cross the Danube here there will be nothing to help them build an offensive position.MARCUS AURELIUSCommodus, it's we who are going on the offensive.NARCISSUSThe fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring whenthey're most vulnerable.MARCUS AURELIUSCommodus -- listen to Narcissus, listen to the man who has never lost a battle for Rome! You're young with years ahead of you before you gain the experience to wear the purple!Commodus visibly reacts, but swallows his anger. Marcussits back, weakened from the exchange.COMMODUSFather, you have to rest...MARCUS AURELIUSI'm sorry... all of you, excuse me.They all make shallow bows and turn to leave, but Marcus holds Narcissus' hand. Quintus sees and politely leaves, but Commodus only goes reluctantly.MARCUS AURELIUSI want you to start your work for the last phase of the campaign.NARCISSUSI will, Marcus. But you're going to be well enough to direct it yourself.MARCUS AURELIUSI've made so many mistakes, Narcissus. We all put off the verylast duties of our lives because we're afraid of admitting when ourlives are over.NARCISSUSThere's no reason to say that.Everyone knows you're going to be well. I had Servis groom your horse for a triumphal visit to the front at first light.MARCUS AURELIUSServis made it through again?NARCISSUSHe's like you, sir, too tough for the Gods to swallow.Marcus laughs and looks like he's better just talking withNarcissus. But now he holds Narcissus' hand with both ofhis.MARCUS AURELIUSIf I'd ever had a sign that you wanted to rule I would have... no,again, it's my own bullheadedness.Narcissus, I should have adopted you years ago. And now the Gods are begging me to make you my son!NARCISSUSCommodus is just a young man, he'll learn what you had to learn.MARCUS AURELIUSIt's not because he's young, it's because he's ignorant and arrogant.His sister is a better man. That's why I have undertaken to beginsweeping changes in the relationship between the emperor and the Senate.NARCISSUSSo I understand.MARCUS AURELIUSEveryone talking about it? I wouldn't wonder. All I seek is agenuine balance of power between the Emperor and the Senate. Thus I have transferred legal power -- which was theirs to begin with -- back to the Senators. This includes a shared right to taxation too but some bite in the plan. It's a start, only a start. If the Emperor and theSenate can share power then the people will be ready to take theirshare. This means Commodus has to bend; does he strike you as thattype?NARCISSUSYou're too hard on him. He is a strong young man, with you as hisguide...MARCUS AURELIUSA man should be upright, not be kept upright.(pause)History shows us that a good general is quick to recognize opportunities -- even if it means making a complete about face at the last minute. I want you to consider becoming my heir.NARCISSUSMarcus, you honor me, but I'm a soldier, politics scare the hell outof me.MARCUS AURELIUSThe Senators admire you.NARCISSUSThey fear me.MARCUS AURELIUSThey fear change. The new Caesar must be honest enough to know when the emperorship is no longer feasible. You could be the one, theEmperor, the man who oversees the rebirth of the Republic.NARCISSUSI'll do anything in my power to help you restore the Republic but I can't be that power.The door creeps open and Galen slips in followed by Commodus.GALENGeneral; the emperor needs my full attention. Please? He must havehis elixirs.MARCUS AURELIUSDon't waste time. Finish our work... Swear!NARCISSUSI swear, Marcus.Marcus smiles, but grips his hand.MARCUS AURELIUSI'm going to miss riding the lines with you, Narcissus...HALLWAYCommodus walks Narcissus to the door himself.COMMODUSYou and my father have become very close. Perhaps one day I may say the same for us.NARCISSUSYou flatter me, Caesar.COMMODUSBeing as close, I'm certain you've noticed what we all have noticed.NARCISSUSCaesar?COMMODUSThat this illness has clouded his mind.He shuts the door with an ominous finality.EXT. MARCUS AURELIUS' QUARTERS - NIGHTNarcissus turns and runs straight into Lucilla who's been waiting for him. Her reaction is to put her arms around his neck and look up into his smiling face. But he's just amused.LUCILLAI thought all good generals were quick to recognize opportunities.NARCISSUSSneaking around with your brother?LUCILLAWithout him. He'd be weeping if he overheard that. Well? The idea ofyou as my adopted brother is very... exciting.NARCISSUSI'm not fit for the job and as a matter of fact I'm not taking the job.LUCILLAWhy do you keep playing at being so humble? It's a little mbarrassing.NARCISSUSWhy do you play at being drunk?LUCILLAHow do you know I am playing? Well, the clown is always harmless. Isn't that right? And how did you ever get to know me so well? The last we spent any time together I was fourteen. I think you know mebetter than my father.(pause)He's going to die, isn't he?NARCISSUSI don't believe that. He's got the best doctor in the world and a willof iron. You know we're preparing for a full-blown invasion ofGermany.LUCILLAOf course I know -- who do you think is paying for it? The Emperorhimself, didn't you know? Why do you think Commodus came rushing up to the front? Burning patriotism?Filial love? He wants to be sure when he takes over there's enoughcash left in the treasury to... play Emperor. Watch out for him,Narcissus; he's inexperienced, but... be careful.INT. NARCISSUS' TENT - NIGHTNarcissus painfully pulls his toga over his head and for the first time we really get to see his battle wounds.All the dressings have bled through. He dips fresh bandages in a bowl of hot water... then reaches back and peels off a dressing.ies on a conversation.NARCISSUSPostumas, Lilliana, Guyan,Agrippina, Lartes. The battle is won, my family. Of course, I'm sureyou were there with me, Guyan.Grandmother always said you loved a good fight. Lilliana, I set somelocal fruit at your place tonight.They're not bad. And don't tell me you don't like exotic food.He lights incense that goes up fast seeming to flood the tent with smoke.NARCISSUSWelcome to the table of life, my ancestors.Narcissus hoists his arm onto a folding stool and leans his head on his arm, exhaustion finally taking over. In the dark and the smoke of the incense he falls asleep.THE ANCESTORS...There's a moment when their faces seem somehow alive in the ghostly, shimmering smoke.VOICEDaddy... Daddy! Daddy wake up!NARCISSUSslowly focuses on the portraits in the muted dawn light.In front of the portraits is the beaming face of a YOUNGGIRL. She's his six year old daughter THEMIS, a black-haired, dark eyed beauty.NARCISSUSThemis!She holds a DOLL up in his face: it's a doll dressed up like a Roman General.THEMISThis is you, daddy.He picks her up and spins around to find his wife SELENE with their older daughter MANTO. Now the others rush to embrace him. A thirty-year old male house-hold slave -- LINDO -- enters carrying woven bags of personal belongings.NARCISSUSSelene! Manto! Lindo, too! Oh,gods... how did you get here?EXT. CAMP - NEAR THE DANUBE - MORNINGAs the family walks along the edge of a slow moving, peaceful bend of the great river, Themis holds her doll for Narcissus' approval.Lindo walks close; though a slave he's clearly part of the family.Narcissus takes the toy likeness, makes sure his daughtersees he's giving it a serious scrutiny.NARCISSUSHe's very realistic.SELENEIsn't the helmet magnificent?THEMISI made the plume from a quail feather.NARCISSUSMuch more colorful than the ones we wear. And, of course, less dented.MANTOFather, is it true the Germans arejust fighting to protect their land?Narcissus and Selene swap a fast look.SELENEWell, you wanted the girls to have the best teachers.NARCISSUSGreeks?SELENEAthenians...That sounds even worse.MANTOTeacher says that the divine Julius used the Germans as a pretext todissolve the Republic.NARCISSUSDid he now...?MANTOAnd that the Germans are only struggling to keep their honor andthe ways of their people. And that throughout history Rome has always been the aggressor.NARCISSUSWell, remind teacher: once upon a time it was the Hebrews over thePhilistines; the Babylonians over the Hebrews; Egypt over Babylon; the Greeks over the Trojans; Persians over the Greeks; Etruscans over the Latins; Sabines over the Latins and Etruscans. Now it's Rome over everyone and I don't know when the world has known such peace.MANTOI can't wait to tell my teachers all that!Can see Narcissus feels better about this already.NARCISSUSWhat about their philosophy lessons?SELENEThey're studying with Cynics.NARCISSUSOf course...THEMISDaddy, Lindo says these forest are haunted by sprites and spirits! Can we go to bed early so we can meet them in our dreams?Narcissus and Selene catch Lindo's smile...INT. TENT - LATE NIGHTNarcissus and Selene making love in the dark. From outside come distant lightning flashes followed by the hollow roll of far off thunder.Finally Selene collapses against Narcissus, but it looks like she could go on for another hour if she just weren't simply exhausted. They laugh quietly at their passion.SELENEYou need to come home!NARCISSUSI can see that...SELENEThe battle is over. The war is over. You've won!NARCISSUSIf you win, you know, you have to stay. It's the losers who get to gohome. Besides, I'm not so sure it is over. Centurions report enemyscouts probing our lines.Selene sighs, then gets an idea and slides out of bed; she returns with a long necked jug.SELENELook what we've brought you all the way from Spain.He looks at the jug and the label.NARCISSUSThis is our oil from our estates?SELENEI've been overseeing production myself for the past three years,you'll be surprised at how wonderful our oil has become.She pushed the bottle neck between her naked breasts and smiles.SELENEIf you want to know, you'll have to come and get it.Narcissus puts his hands on the base of the bottle, then lets his hand slide to her breast. But she moves the bottle aside, pulls him close -- but he snatches the bottle and gives it a good look.NARCISSUSVery fancy. Did you design the bottle?SELENEWho else? I'm the one who runs the estates while you're here riskingeverything we have for the glory of Rome! Or for the glory of you!NARCISSUSI'm a soldier -- we're at war. I can't stay home tending the damnedolive groves?SELENEWe don't need your help we're doing great on our own.Narcissus cools down, sees this is going a bad way.NARCISSUSI want to come home, of course I do, I'd have to be mad not to want that.It's just that Marcus trusts me.SELENELet him trust Quintus.NARCISSUSQuintus is overly idealistic.SELENEI never knew a more idealistic man than you.NARCISSUSMe? Well, I believe in Rome... you'd have to after what I've seen,how people outside the empire treat each other.SELENEI don't even want to imagine the things you've seen...NARCISSUSWhat you don't want to imagine is the things I've done.Silence. All the while they've been talking the storm hasbeen slowly approaching, thunder beating ominously closer.Selene embraces him.Suddenly Manto and Themis leap into bed with them and pushbeneath their bearskin blanket. Themis is crying and Manto is shaken.SELENEGirls! What's the trouble? Manto?MANTOLindo was right! This is a haunted place! The night spirits came tous...THEMISWe had horrible nightmares!Lightning flashes and thunder drops like a bomb as the storm settles on the camp. The girls pull themselves close to Selene and Narcissus.INT. NARCISSUS' TENT - LATE AFTERNOONThemis and Manto help Selene and Lindo pack the last of several baskets.NARCISSUSDon't stop to visit -- take the children straight home and I'll follow as soon as I can.THEMISTomorrow?NARCISSUSAs soon as I can.THEMISOn your honor as a Roman officer, daddy?NARCISSUSOn my honor as your daddy...One of Narcissus personal guards enters.PERSONAL GUARDSir, Caesar Commodus and Quintus Clarus to see you.\ONARCISSUSTell them to come in!Commodus and Quintus enter as the guard returns to his post. Quintus sets his helmet down. He's wearing his lorica segmentata.QUINTUSSelene, girls.Commodus nods as Selene motions for the children to sit quietly.QUINTUSMarcus Aurelius has died.COMMODUSHe left us at dawn.Everyone stunned. Selene embraces the children.Narcissus slowly sits back at the table.COMMODUSPlease accept my deepest sympathy as you were one of his most loyal officers.Narcissus takes out four scrolls, hands them to Commodus.NARCISSUSThese were my latest reports to Marcus.But Quintus takes them.COMMODUSI want to extend my hand in gratitude for what you have done formy father and Rome, and to offer my friendship. The next few weeks will be trying. As you know Marcus wisely or unwisely laid thefoundations for greater Senatorial control and there are those likelyto take advantage of his good intentions. Will you join me instrengthening my government? As you know your support, your friendship at this critical moment would silence a dangerous faction.While they speak Quintus unrolls the documents. He's not happy reading them.QUINTUSSerious stuff...NARCISSUSCenturions on both sides of the river are convinced the Germans willtry one last offensive. They've got nothing to lose and it's so verylike them.Commodus and Quintus swap a fast look.COMMODUSI'm ordering a general stand-down in preparation for withdrawal backacross the Danube.NARCISSUSWe have to stop the Germans now!QUINTUSWe must obey our emperor and the Senate.COMMODUSI met with Falco, and the Senators have agreed to call for a truce withthe Germans.NARCISSUSForgive me, Caesar, but do two Senator represent the mood of thewhole Senate or the will of the Roman people? Besides, every trucewe make with the Germans they break!COMMODUSThey won't break this one.NARCISSUSApparently my opinion wasn't needed.QUINTUSEveryone knew you would have been outspoken against this deal.NARCISSUSWhat deal?QUINTUSRome is going to pay an allotment to the German tribes on an annualbasis.Narcissus reacts as if he'd been stabbed.NARCISSUSRome is going to pay tribute -- like a defeated nation begging for mercy?Have you told your troops that?QUINTUSMy troops don't make policy.NARCISSUSWell, they die for it!SELENENarcissus -- it's over! Pack and come home with us...COMMODUSYou have a wise woman by your side.NARCISSUSOn his death bed I promised Marcus I would complete our work here. The Senate may be vacillating, but I have the army behind me. I'm taking half a cohort and restocking that fort.QUINTUSI can't let you do that.Narcissus turns and for the first time really looksQuintus over.NARCISSUSIn you armor, Quintus? Is that how you come to visit a friend?They stare at each other. Narcissus goes for his sword just as LEGIONNAIRES rush in. Commodus backs against the tent wall. Narcissus heaves one soldier into the furniture, fells another with a chair and grabs his sword...QUINTUSDon't kill him!Three soldiers tackle Narcissus to the floor. Soldiers grab Selene and the children -- Lindo reaches for a knife and he's immediately killed. The children SCREAM...SELENENarcissus...!INT. CELL - NIGHTarcissus sits in the dirt leaning against the log wall, his hands chained in front of him. The door opens and four heavily armed Praetorian Guard enter.EXT. CELL - NIGHTNarcissus stands in the pouring rain facing Falco, Gaius, Tribuus and several tribunes. Four slaves hold a canvas over Commodus and the others -- as they talk Narcissus continues to be drenched.NARCISSUSWhere is my family?COMMODUSCooperate and they will be returned to your estate. I could haveexecuted you.NARCISSUSAnd my army would have thrown your body into the Danube.They glare at each other in the dark; Commodus' eyes seemto burn in the lamp light.COMMODUSThe army is a problem. They love you. You have led them from victory to victory in the name of Rome and they love you. And after all, you're just a hothead acting from a misguided sense of loyalty -- who could fault you for that?(nods to Falco)Thus have I reached a compromise with the Senate over your fate:instead of executing you, I'm sending you to Rome where you willbe tried...NARCISSUSOn what charge?FALCOInsubordination. To the Emperor... and the Senate.COMMODUSQuintus will tell the army that you are being called to Rome to celebrate your victory. They will hear that you are living in luxury.He will let them feel you have betrayed them for the good life.And soon the army won't even remember your name.All turn and leave but Gaius. Two soldiers hold Narcissus while a third goes through the process of chaining his wrists.NARCISSUSThe Senate too?GAIUSThe moment you returned from the battle your options were clear. Ifyou are a friend to neither side, legate, you must be an enemy toboth. We needed to know what you believed.NARCISSUSI hope you live to see what I believe...At that the soldiers drag Narcissus toward a wagon with tiny barred windows.INT. PRISON WAGON - NIGHTIn the dark Narcissus is chained to a bench and the door slams shut.EXT. PRISON WAGON WHEEL - DAYThe thick spoke wood wheel slams over rocks and ruts of aprimitive forest road.INT. WAGON - DAYNarcissus jars awake and flies swarm off his face. AGERMAN PRISONER is chained to the wall, a rag-wrappedchain around his mouth as a gag. His head nods forward;could be asleep, could be dead. Narcissus leans forwardand is stopped by his own chains. He glares at the rustediron links as if they were the most unbearable insult.JUBANarcissus!At the far end of the wagon is Juba. Looks like he's been worked over pretty good. They stare at each other.JUBAYou on your way to trial, too,general? Or do you think they've already had our trial?NARCISSUSWhy you?JUBAMy loyalties... were in doubt.NARCISSUSFools to let us both live; we'll be our own best witnesses at our trial.JUBAThat's what worries me...Suddenly hands LURCH FOR HIS THROAT but are stopped bychains. It's the gagged German. He drops his arms, butkeeps his eyes lowered staring at the Imperial Roman Eaglearound Narcissus' neck.FADE TO:EXT. ROME - DAYWearing a flowing toga and golden laurel, Commodus ridesinto Rome in a military chariot through the Arch of Titusthat leads down the 'Sacred Road' through the Forum. Askeleton force of legionnaires parade just behind as DRUMMERS beat a brisk tattoo. Tribuus walks ahead of the chariot as two legionnaires hold military standards on high.First they pass the Senate on their left where the Senators stand on the steps to greet him. Falco is out front and raises his arms in welcome. As they pass the Senate they're surrounded by citizens.TRIBUUSMarcus Aurelius Commodus Antoninus Augustus, Emperor of Rome, conqueror of the German tribes! Master of the Danube! All of Rome salutes you!Citizens of Rome line the way. Some cheer, but most are quiet. And that silence is unnerving. Then:VOICERomans do not pay tribute!And that causes a landslide of yelling. Commodus stares dead ahead as they're now forced to run a gauntlet of outraged citizens. Finally his chariot picks up speed as it continues through the forum toward the palace on the Palatine Hill.INT. IMPERIAL PALACE - DUSKWhile Commodus paces like a caged animal, Falco walks to and fro oddly trying to keep up with him. Lucilla sits stretching her legs; after the long trip she looks exhausted. A slave pours wine.FALCOThe Senate is out to sink you. I swear it, Caesar, your generosity isbeing repaid with public attacks on your honor. Your enemies want you weak enough so by the first of Janus when you must be confirmed the Senate will be able to deny you.COMMODUSHow can they? Who else is there? I have no heir...LUCILLAThat's the point, dear brother, your 'heir' is the Senate. And believeme, they know it.FALCODo not take this lightly, Caesar. They mean to abolish the mperorship. If they do you and your sister will be executed.You've got to plan your moves as seriously as if you were going towar.EXT. PRISON WAGON WHEEL - DAYS LATER - NIGHTThe wheel bumps up from a rut and onto a road of preciselycut polygonal lava blocks.INT. PRISON WAGON - DAYThe wagon STOPS. Narcissus wakes and looks across toJuba. With a horrendous BANG the entire side of the wagonfalls away as it's unhinged by SOLDIERS.EXT. PRISON WAGONThe prisoners are lined up facing a rank of soldiers holding them at spear-point. Narcissus now sees that their wagon is part of a convoy of four; all unload prisoners on the edge of a forest.JUBAIs this Rome? Are we just going to be executed?NARCISSUSThey can't... if this is Rome...Narcissus is chained wrist-to-wrist with the German as allthe prisoners are CHAINED IN PAIRS. Juba gets chained toa tall blonde German WARRIOR.NOW EVERYTHING HAPPENS FAST --A DOZEN ARMED MEN with feathers woven into their haircharge at them from the far end of the path and dive themdown a trail that leads between a double row of tall oaks.Cries, hoots and cheers surround them like an INVISIBLEMASS OF HUMANITY and at the end of the grove there's thisunnatural GLOW.IN THE GROWING LIGHTthey emerge into the center of a VAST ARENA that's been'planted' with trees to imitate a forest.From the tops of the sheer twelve foot perimeter walls,banks of seats slope away tier after tier until, at thevery tops of the seating are arch after arch, each framinga marble statue of a different Roman emperor.THE PRISONERS...gawk at the enormous proportions of the building: it'sthe COLOSSEUM of Rome. Looking back at them are FIFTYTHOUSAND FANS -- and as one, like some surreal cannedsound track they all LAUGH.Then to a fanfare of horns and drums a corpulent, self-important man rises. This is JERSES -- head of the RomanCircus. Jerses turns to the imperial box, but the marblethrone-like seat which has a carved wolf relief, is EMPTY.JERSESOn this dawn! In celebration of the New Caesar, Lucius Aelius Aurelius Commodus' glorious triumph over the German tribes I declare these games -- which will run without interruption to the month of Janus -- open to one and all!HOWLS and CHEERS from the audience -- many in the 'bestseats' (nearest the arena) rise and directly applaudJerses.NARCISSUSSearching the row of prisoners he sees Juba staring deadahead.JERSESIn sacrifice for Rome that the world might know the new Emperor's love for his citizens, during these games two hundred pairs of gladiators will fight to the death...!(deafening cheers)One thousand criminals will be devoured by wild beasts... thereshall be venationes! Battles be- twixt elephants and rhinoceroses;bears and bulls; leopards and lions; exotic animals never seen in Rome -- captured by our legions in their triumph in Africa -- will be hunted to the death!Narcissus is staggered -- his head pivots around at the frantic, blood-lusting crowd.ARCHERS...emerge from a door in a wall of the Colosseum, bows strungover their shoulders, each carries a small jug and eacharcher approaches a pair of chained-together prisoners.As they DAUB PAINT on the prisoners' arms -- a particularNUMBER for each pair -- spectators rise, pointing atdifferent pairs, some jotting notes. Juba and the Blondeget daubed with a red 'III'.SLAVE #1Wagers! Make your wagers -- visit the Blue Betting booths! Remember the number of your favorite pair!SLAVE #2Red Booths -- bet at the Red Booths!The Red Booths always give you the best odds! The Red Booths -- open until curfew!A young, SURLY-LOOKING ARCHER gets to Narcissus and theGerman. He snorts his disdain, then daubs a black Romannumeral 'V' onto the German's arm -- but when he paintsNarcissus he decks the archer with his free hand. The audience CHEERS and there's a spurt of note-taking in the stands.FROM THE CHEAP SEATS --a lanky GREEK, PROXIMO PALINDROMOS, instantly flashes hisdark eyes down into the mass of prisoners.PROXIMO'S POVHard to see anything from this far up. He starts to turn away when the German Warrior steps aside and as Narcissus is revealed his OMAN EAGLE FLASHES.AND PROXIMOsuddenly very interested... Quickly he looks across to the opposite side of the arena where a pencil-thin man in a dark green toga sits beside Jerses, also scrutinizing the prisoners. He looks RIGHT UP AT PROXIMO. The man is LYKAS.INT. COLOSSEUMNarcissus is shoved down an immense stone hallway mad withactivity.Juba is rushed along twenty feet ahead. Behind the huge doors are drawn closed by two burly slaves but at the last second they stop to let Proximo in.RAMPNarcissus herded with the others down a steep ramp. Theypass...-- huge baskets of FLOWERS being ground to juice and dumped into a sluice.-- the side of a cage; as Narcissus passes, a leopard SLAMS against the bars.-- Narcissus is pushed on, deeper into the guts of the Colosseum. He gets a ast glimpse of a room where BUTCHERS chop out slabs of meat. Bleeding ribs dangle from hooks...-- SLAVES charge in opposite directions along a tunnel yanking pulley ropes as a CAGED BEAR rises from below.-- But now they're pushed deeper into the darkening 'basement' until finally they reach --THE 'HOLE'Slaves wait with oil lamps to light their way as they run in a semi-squat beneath the low stone ceiling. Prisoners GASP in the choking air while around them come the banshee wails of other PRISONERS. Finally they stop and Narcissus and Juba come face-to-face.JUBAFight! Feohtan!But Juba is knocked down by two guards -- one rears back to spear him when Narcissus throws himself in front of Juba...PROXIMOStop! Stop!The guard instantly backs off as torches converge lighting up the claustrophobic tunnel. Proximo steps into the light as Narcissus stands. Then he takes hold of Narcissus' Roman Eagle.PROXIMOIs this your?Narcissus GRABS the eagle and shoves Proximo back.Proximo nods to slaves and Narcissus' chain is held upagainst the wall and with two blows the links are brokenith a hammer. Narcissus is yanked back the way he came.He just has time to look over his shoulder to see Jubashoved into the hole and the door SLAMS behind them.MAIN HALLExhausted, Narcissus is rushed back up the ramp into themain hall where Proximo waits. Then a side door opens andOUTSIDE LIGHT explodes in like a flashgun.EXT. COLOSSEUM - DAYNarcissus is led -- chained -- into the streets, armed slaves urge him along as ahead Proximo rides in a sedanchair.-- FOOD AND DRINK VENDORS shout and wave samples of theirwares;-- TICKET SCALPERS hold up IVORY TICKETS yelling outColosseum seat numbers;-- BOOKMAKERS stand on tables -- some with RED headbands,some with BLUE -- screaming out names of various gladiators and indicating their 'odds' with fingers as citizens queue up to bet;-- RELIC HAWKERS hold up pieces of gladiatorial armoryelling the name of the dead gladiator and the numberof his victories;-- Lion paws and leopard ears are touted as potencymedicines;-- WHORES bare-chested with wildly painted breasts linethe road taking customers into the alleys...EXT. PROXIMO'S GLADIATORIAL SCHOOL - DAYThey approach ornate double wooden gates with carved action scenes of gladiators in battle.INT. PROXIMO'S INSULA - GLADIATOR SCHOOL - DAYNarcissus enters with two powerful armed SLAVES who unchain him and give him water and bread. Proximo sits behind his 'desk' which is a slab of thick rose volcanic rock polished to a high luster, its corners supported by salvaged marble BUSTS painted in the original garish Greek style: faces pink, hair brown or blond, eyes white with brown or blue irises.Gaudy mosaics of gladiatorial battles hang on the wall over his table. Narcissus eyeballs the setup: everything but pink flamingos.With Proximo is ADONIS THE BOXER: a tall, thick man, facedeeply scarred, nose pulverized. The other is an albinodwarf -- DALA. Dala has Jimmy Winters -- white hair andalmost crimson eyes.Proximo stares at Narcissus for a time as Dala pours him acup of wine. Finally, Proximo drinks.PROXIMOWelcome to Rome.(pause)Who are you?Instead of answering, Narcissus holds out his cup.PROXIMOYou're a legate in the Roman army.Huh...? and you act like one.What was your crime?NARCISSUSI killed too many barbarians.PROXIMOI'm a Greek, thank you. And I was brought up believing Romans were the barbarians.(to slave)Give our new colleague some of the Cretan white. Relax, tell meeverything, I'm your friend.Dala fills Narcissus' cup. After a second of hesitation Narcissus drinks... and it's good.NARCISSUSWho the hell are you?PROXIMOI am the man who might save your life -- give you a bit more life atany rate. I am Proximo Palindromos head of this gladiatorial schoolwhich is named after me. I own this school and everything that's in it.(laughs)You're in it! But why? What did a Roman general do to get himselfcondemned to the Colosseum?Understand, we usually get corn thieves and pick pockets. Please, Iseparated you from the others because...(sniffs loudly)... my nose tells me you've been condemned for important reasons.NARCISSUSCondemned? Aren't I owed a trial before being condemned?PROXIMOGeneral, all I know is you have been condemned to the Colosseum, and a trial is nowhere to be seen.NARCISSUSImpossible! Every citizen has a right to trial -- this is Rome!One of the attending SLAVES chuckles and is hushed by aglare from Proximo.PROXIMOIn Rome, you will discover, all things -- especially the mostunthinkable -- are possible. What were you charged with?Now Narcissus won't talk.PROXIMOWell, it probably doesn't matter.Probably you'll be dead tomorrow.But it might matter tonight because I'm going to plead with Jerses head of the circus to have you instituted as a gladiator immediately. He's a loathsome pig but in this business one doesn't get to choose one's friends. Your business too, maybe?Oh yes, the arena slaves took this from you. It's yours, isn't it?A slave hands Narcissus' small box of ancestors to Proximo who hands it to Narcissus.NARCISSUSThank you. What is going to happen tomorrow? Exactly?PROXIMOYou are to be killed, exactly.They'll give you a sporting chance, but just enough to make yourmurder... entertaining. Romans like to mix their metaphors: laughterwith their executions, you know? If you survive, though, you will become a gladiator. A gladiator at least gets a fair fight.NARCISSUSDeath is a very light thing for you.PROXIMODeath is... everything for me. Now you have to go to your cell, and Ito dicker with Jerses... you'll be fed well. I want you to be fit asyou can be; I want you to win for me tomorrow! I want all my gladiators to win and be happy! Besides, I've never owned a Roman general before.EXT. GLADIATOR SCHOOL YARD - DAYNarcissus is led through the yard -- notes Adonis on his right and Dala following along behind. Two armed slaves flank them in a tight formation. Dala and Adonis watch Narcissus with a mix of curiosity and awe; Adonis knows what he's thinking.ADONISEscape is impossible, general.First you have these guards who will not hesitate to kill you. Then youhave the Praetorian Guard, and then the Rome city police...DALAThe vigiles, Vigilant Patrols.They're everywhere... you don't know if maybe even your best friend could be a spy.GLADIATORS range around the walled-in open space -- like amini-arena -- working out in the sunshine. Some lift WEIGHTS made from crude chunks of iron or rock; there's a primitive BOW-FLEX DEVICE made from real bows. Bored armed GUARDS range the walkway atop the wall.A PIECE OF CLOTH WEIGHTED DOWN WITH A ROCK flutters overthe wall and thuds in the square and there's a short scramble as gladiators rush for it. Finally the 'note' is passed on to Adonis.ADONISCrassus, it's for you.A tall, handsome gladiator: "CRASSUS THE SPARTAN" whosehair is woven with TINY SILVER BELLS, stands beside Adonisin expectation.CRASSUSCome on! Tell me what it says!ADONIS(reading)"I dream of your muscles, dearCrassus!"(howls from theothers)"... and pray the one between your legs is as large as the one betweenyour ears is small!"Hoots as Crassus grabs the 'note' away from Adonis.DALAFor a price Proximo can manage a meeting for any lady...A gladiator with Bad Teeth moves up to intercept Narcissus. The man's lost teeth are replaced with glued- in bits of colored stone. He looks Narcissus over, scoffs and returns to his friends. As they pass along a wall it dips to waist level over a sheer drop. Narcissus stops at the view.FAR BELOW... is the FORUM OF ROME with its bustling street and squares and magnificent buildings.From here Narcissus can see the Roman Temples: that ofthe Divine Claudius; Venus and Rome; Mars Ultor; the Temple of Minerva; of Peace; the Divine Julius; of Castor and Pollux; of the Vestal Virgins. Each like a miniature Parthenon seems to faintly GLOW.FURTHER...Beyond are the Domus of the upper classes and the insula of the poor. Actually overwhelmed by the sight; perhaps it gives Narcissus hope.INT. CELL - DUSKTIGHT ON the ceramic FACE OF HIS ANCESTORS looking like arow of hollow caricatures. They seem to be watching...NARCISSUSwho sits in the shadows of his cell that's twenty feet square. There are two barred windows, one on the rear wall and another on the side wall. Finally Narcissus rises... he takes up one of the ceramics, snaps a piece off on the side of the table to get a nice sharp edge. Herolls back his sleeves and starts to open the vein of his left wrist.FROM ABOVE Dala shouts down from a small window in theroof. The cell door flies back and TWO SLAVES tackle Narcissus. Dala enters followed by Proximo. Dala pushes one of the slaves aside and grabs Narcissus' wrist.NARCISSUSTake your hands off me animal!PROXIMOChain him.The slaves immediately bind Narcissus' wrists with a leather strap that's locked with a metal cleat.PROXIMOSorry but I have to get at least one fight out of you otherwise I won'teven get back the cost of the bribe I had to pay the arena slaves to getyou here. I know what you're trying to do: kill yourself and trust inthe Roman tradition of justice that the emperor will let your familysurvive and keep their lands. The only thing you have accomplishes isto prove you're a very important individual. You make me feel goodabout my investment! And that puking pig Jerses -- he won't evendiscuss you. Both of you have clamped mouths! But I love all myfighters -- I'll find out about your family. And about you. That Ipromise.NARCISSUSI refuse to be your slave. Irefuse --PROXIMO-- to fight? We'll see...Proximo leaves and the door shuts behind him. Narcissus is left chained in the dark.INT. GLADIATOR WAGON - MORNINGThe side of a broad barred opening like an animal circus wagon designed to show-off the creatures inside. The gladiators watch Narcissus: various men, all colors, all showing battle scars...GANG KIDS dressed like gladiators chase the wagon shouting: "Gladiator -- Hey, Gladiator!" "Crassus!Crassus The Spartan! Throw us a head" "Hey -- Bad Teeth!" Who you going to skewer today?!"Most catch up to the wagon slogging along in rush-hourtraffic and hammer the sides with their FISTS.Fascinated, Narcissus leans close to the bars -- LITTLEKID FACES peer back.BLOND KIDYou're new! Hey! A new one!MANY KIDSYou're dead! They're gonna rip your guts out! You're dead -- dead!Dead guts!Then they pass the senate steps -- Senator Gaius and anAGED SENATOR who seems from another era, GRACCHUS, address a crowd. The kids peel away from the wagon and shovethrough the audience. Narcissus presses to the bars for a good look.BAD TEETHFriends of yours?The gladiators laugh. But as they pass, Narcissus watches the senators.GAIUSShall we allow Commodus to turn the labor of Marcus Aurelius upside down? Are we Romans or dogs?!The KIDS START BARKING. The cart veers toward theenormous flank of the Colosseum. A FAT PERSIAN TICKETSCALPER and his two young SONS man a table holding ivoryColosseum tickets like fans of cards, shouting seats andprices.FOUR ROME WHORES ending their day laugh and wave at thecart. A CUTE WHORE in a yellow wig blows them a kiss.SOUNDS OF THE COLOSSEUM CROWD RISE OVER...EXT. COLOSSEUM ARENA - DAYFEET of the MOB in the Colosseum stamping as their chanting VOICES echo in shock waves through the giant marble chamber.AND COMMODUSStanding for the crowd. He's surrounded by members of theImperial Household -- Lucilla on his right beside Falco.Commodus sits, seems nervous.LUCILLADon't you think you should at least wave?COMMODUSWhy? Then they'll notice when I'm gone. Well. I'm making a publicappearance aren't I?ARENAGLADIATORS parade single file through the arena. They strut their stuff: flexing their muscles, gesturing obscenely as they receive the cat-calls of young girls.SATURNUS -- a muscular gladiator with waist-length wavyhair stops to bask in the animal howls of the crowd.NARCISSUSstands inside a heavily guarded double door watching theaction. As the 'Proximo gladiators' come in off the fieldthey sit on blocks of stone lining the wall. Then,Narcissus spots Commodus and moves closer to the opening.Saturnus stops directly in front of the Imperial Box,lifts his hand in the Roman salute -- which was the modelfor the Fascist's salute.SATURNUSCaesar! Those who are about to die,salute you!It's the cue for the crowd to go WILD. Again Commoduslooks around at this vast arena. He tentatively makes abroad wave and instead of getting the expected universalcheers, some LOUD BOOS jab up at him from the cheap seats.Commodus is outraged.FALCOCaesar, ignore them.COMMODUSIgnore that?! The sooner we leave this disgusting place the better.FALCOAt least stay for the running of the animals. You are paying for it youknow... set of tall doors are pulled back by pairs of slaves andANIMALS RUSH INTO THE ARENA. WILDEBEESTS -- HYENAS --ANTELOPE -- ZEBRAS -- WILD ASSES -- BEARS -- JACKALS --even a LONE HIPPO... blunder off the smooth marble walls in terrified confusion. Commodus seems physically struck.FALCOThe money was set aside for your father's triumph. The people expect it.COMMODUSGods of hell! This must cost a fortune! How many days is thisgoing to go on?FALCOUntil your confirmation date.Commodus looks back out on the arena where every animal must look like a heap of cash.COMMODUSA month! The treasury is bleeding... and these pigs expect meto sponsor their amusement while they boo me?Commodus turns and his entourage follows him out.NARCISSUSmoves closer to the opening, trying to see through the dust and animals but gets shoved back. The other gladiators sit on stones, backs to the action. There's an 'imminent feeling' like soldiers gathered in a trench before battle. Narcissus turns back to the arena.MOUNTED HUNTERS --Carrying javelins charge into the arena.And while they corner animals and impale them a LONE MAN-- a 'Colosseum Clown' rushes across the sands with a furious BEAR hot on his heels.The Colosseum Clown reaches the far end of the arena and 'runs' up the slick marble side using his momentum. As the bear lunges for him he flips off the wall, over the bear and starts running the other way. The crowd goes wild for it.LOWER CELLS/THE HOLE...ABSOLUTE BLACKNESS. A solid door pulls back and faintlight reveals Juba collapsed in the filth of the cave-like cell. Drenched with perspiration he gasps in the 'fresh' air and like the other prisoners looks nearly asphyxiated.Arena Slaves poke torches at them.ARENA SLAVECome on! Time to meet Pluto!GLADIATOR AREAAs Dala jabbers on, the PRISONERS are rushed up from thedepths of the Colosseum.DALAI usually fight women gladiators or other dwarfs. Sometimes I ride into battle on an ostrich. Women are ruthless! Ostriches can break your arm with a single kick!Narcissus is yanked to his feet by armed slaves and chained to the German Warrior who bears the same blue paint smear as he. They study one another, brothers in pain. Narcissus searches the faces and sees Juba is one of the last men being pulled out of the 'hole' by a chain. Bad Teeth looks up:BAD TEETHThey're going to bet on you:whoever dies last wins! So longgeneral...AT THE DOORThe prisoners are lined up as the last of the dead animalsare dragged off. A slave dumps short gladius swords froma sack, the prisoners scramble to arm themselves. At thelast second Proximo shoves through and grabs hold ofNarcissus' arm.PROXIMOLegate Narcissus Meridas, general of the Spanish Felix Legions! I'mproud to have you in my school!(picks up a sword)Now, show them what you can do!NARCISSUSI'm not a gladiator. I refuse to fight.PROXIMOThen, you'll die...(off his silence)Just, know this: because you askedI asked: I'm sorry but...A HORN BLOWS and the Colosseum Slaves herd the prisonersout in a rush.PROXIMO... the emperor has executed your family!Narcissus is YANKED ahead.EXT. ARENANarcissus is so staggered by this news he seems barely able to walk.JUBANarcissus! A sword! Get a sword!As the prisoners are double-timed around the arena spectators rise like a Dodger Wave, shouting and pointing out pairs -- money swaps hands. Arena Slaves circle quickly with rakes smoothing the sand over the animal blood.JERSESCitizens! Make your final wagers!Jerses unrolls a scroll. As he speaks ARCHERS line upagainst the wall directly beneath Jerses facing the prisoners.JERSESPrisoners, you have been found guilty of offenses against theFatherland: In the name of Caesar Lucius Aelius Aurelius Commodus and the Senate of Rome, you have been condemned to the arena, beneath the beneath. Fight well -- live long!NARCISSUSbarely has time to absorb this when the archers take aim.PANICKED prisoners trip over their own chains, collidingwith each other.The German crosses in front of Narcissus and is hit squarein the chest with an arrow. Instinctively Narcissus triesto help the German but the man slides out of his arms andcrumples dead in the sand. Narcissus looks UP as thecrowd cheers...ANDABATAE ENTER...They're gladiators with faces hidden by helmets; carryingTHRUSTING SPEARS they look like EXECUTIONER ROBOTS.Narcissus sees that one man of each chained-together pairhas been killed and then that Juba is still alive. EachAndabatus squares off with a surviving prisoner.JUBANarcissus -- fight! Fight!The crowd ROARS as the Andabatae attack. The 'joke' isNarcissus -- like the other prisoners -- has to drag a dead man around while fighting for his life.Narcissus dodges the first blow but the movement yanks hischain taunt and he falls -- barely rolls clear of the nextblow. Spectators CHEER and LAUGH; the Andabatus circleskeeping Narcissus stretched to the limit of his chain.Juba lurches, nicks the Andabatus and has time to grab thesword of the dead Blonde German.JUBAGeneral!Juba heaves the sword toward Narcissus, turns to parryaway the Andabatus. The crowd HOWLS...Narcissus sees the sword is within grabbing range but hestill won't go for it. Then the crowd SHOUTS...JUBA GOES DOWN...The Andabatus straddles the badly wounded man, salutes theaudience and kills him. Narcissus now sees he's the lastprisoner left alive.Narcissus' Andabatus lunges and as Narcissus quickly pullsout of range he falls forward foot coiled in the chain.Now it looks like it's all over -- the crowd goes wildwith expectation.The Andabatus raises his weapon over Narcissus asspectators poke their chest with their thumbs to symbolizethey want Narcissus killed. He looks to Jerses fororders.NARCISSUSsees Juba dead, his blood in the sand. And suddenlysomething happens to him -- with every once of energyleft, Narcissus grabs the sword, and CHOPS through theACHILLES TENDON of the Andabatus' left leg. The AndabatusDROPS as Narcissus lunges out with the sword and the manFALLS on the blade.It's over. Narcissus rolls on his side to face up atJerses who still stands about to give the death command --his mouth DROPS.AND PROXIMOgot those Don King Eyes... Adonis and Dala come forward.PROXIMODid you see that?! Did you see?! I knew he was a fighter! A realfighter!THE AUDIENCE --GOES WILD. Especially those in the cheap seats.Narcissus stands with the chain to the dead German in hishand. Then he looks over to where Juba has fallen in thesand. A man dressed in A COSTUME OF BLACK SCALES and amonster head walks to each prisoner administering a coupde grace by clubbing them with a big HAMMER. He's'PLUTO'.Narcissus drags the chain with the body of the Germanbehind him until he reaches Juba's side. Pluto seesNarcissus protecting Juba's body and decides to take a'pass'.Finally, exhausted, Narcissus drops to his knees on theburning sand. Lowering his head as cheers of the crowdsurround him...IMPERIAL ENTRANCE - COLOSSEUMAt ground level at the dead end of a long hall Lucillawatches through an ornate stone grate. Of course, she'sseen everything.TRIBUUSLady, are you coming?She's startled to find Tribuus has come looking for her.She nods, shoves past and he follows her down the hallwithout a single backward glance.INT. IMPERIAL 'CHAIR' - LATER AFTERNOONCommodus and Lucilla ride along in silence, PraetorianGuard walking ahead to part the crowd. As they pass theSenate, Commodus points to a clutch of CITIZENS gatheredon the steps.COMMODUSThey're talking about me.Lucilla gives him the hard stare. But then all the citizens turn to watch the Imperial Chair pass.COMMODUSThey hate me, they really hate me don't they?LUCILLAMaybe you should get married. Pick one of your cousins, it woulddemonstrate a profound stability.Commodus puts his hand on her leg.COMMODUSWhat about you?They just stare at each other. As he talks he continues to feel under her toga to her hip. She tries to remainamused.COMMODUSI should at least have you, don'tyou think?LUCILLAIf you get me pregnant with a boy he'll be a double direct heir andwill end up killing you for the throne.He freezes -- absolutely turned off -- and takes away his hand.COMMODUSDid Narcissus die today? Wasn't this his day to die?LUCILLAI'm sure, I don't know.Finally he removes his hand and leans out the opening to Tribuus who rides alongside.COMMODUSTribuus, what happened in the arena?Was Narcissus killed?TRIBUUSHe must have been. He was on the list of prisoners to be executed.LUCILLANo one in Rome has ever heard of him. Do you want to remind thosefew in the Senate who have? The whole sordid thing is far beneathyour position to begin with. Forget about him.COMMODUSLet some time pass... then ask, quietly, without anyone knowing itcomes from me.TRIBUUSLeave it to me, Caesar.INT. NARCISSUS' CELL - LATE AFTERNOONNarcissus has drunk himself unconscious and lies face downon the table. The door swings open and Proximo enters with an armed guard and COS, a handsome young man who looks like a student. As the light sweeps in through the open door Narcissus blinks awake.PROXIMONarcissus Meridas, general of the Spanish VII, famed Felix Legions.I'm proud to have you in my school!Narcissus staggers to his feet and crosses to the rear window. He leans against the bars and gulps cool air.PROXIMOGeneral, do you realize what happened out there today?NARCISSUSI didn't get killed and everyone else did.PROXIMOThat's one way to look at it.COSYou won an impossible fight. You got the attention of the crowd,legate...PROXIMOThis is Cos, this precocious young man. A scribe for the DailyAction.(1) I've invited him to write a small piece about you...COSI'm mentioning you in tomorrow's athlete's section, legate. So, I'dlove to know your birth sign; it effects how people bet. And perhapsyou could tell me a bit about... well, who are you?Narcissus looks from one to the other then back to his view of Rome which looks like lead in shadows.NARCISSUSI don't have a birth sign...Cos looks to Proximo who starts to speak but realizes the interview is over...INT. NARCISSUS' CELL - LATE AFTERNOONNarcissus crouches in the corner slowly sipping his winestaring at the 'faces' of his ancestors.NARCISSUSJanus, God of passages, I know youexist...(pause)I beg you open the door for Selene, Manto, and my little Themis to the land of our ancestors. I have no fit offering for the task I ask, butif you save my ladies one day I will find a sacrifice worthy of you.Dala's face peers in from above.DALADon't let Proximo push you around.Proximo must, by law, give you a third of everything he makes off you outside the arena. Popular gladiators get rich!Narcissus grabs his wine jug and throws it at Dala who leaps out of sight. Then Narcissus picks up a stone and stands over the images of his ancestors.ON HIS ANCESTORS...One by one he SMASHES EACH FACE. SOUNDS OF THE COLOSSEUMRISE OVER as if cheering him on...INT. COLOSSEUM - GLADIATOR AREA - MORNINGA SWORD drops in the dirt. Narcissus looks up to findProximo with an Arena Slave who holds a sack of swords.PROXIMOWe're calling you "Narcissus The Good." It's in the Daily Action.A CHEER from the crowd and Narcissus glances toward thearena.HE SEES...Crassus has speared a panther which drops, clawing hopelessly at the blade stuck in its throat. To resounding cheers, Crassus holds up his arms, playing to his audience. Then with a huge show he straddles the cat and kills it with a dagger -- the crowd erupts...NARCISSUSpicks the sword up so fast the point almost catches Proximo in the face. Proximo straightens, scowls and moves off. Bad Teeth chuckles. But when he gets the cold stare from Narcissus he turns away, chuckling to himself.ARENANarcissus faces a Hoplomachi. The Hoplomachi looks completely protected in lead grey armor. He carries a round shield and a long sword. Narcissus walks slowly toward him and the audience hushes.NARCISSUSSurrender or I'll kill you!People just crack-up...SPECTATORNarcissus The Good!As one the audience howls throwing trash down into thearena.Narcissus drops his shield, grips his sword with both hands -- feints -- the Hoplomachi misses left and Narcissus comes down full force on the man's helmet.Narcissus' sword SPLITS THE HELMET AND STAYS THERE.

FORUM - LATE AFTERNOONOutside the Senate Tribuus with ten Praetorian Guard face down an angry demonstration.INT. SENATE - LATE AFTERNOONCommodus faces the challenging, stoic wall of Senators in their pure white togas. Falco sits prominently near the front. From outside come the sounds of the mob.COMMODUSSenators. There was no more fair man than my father. A man oflearning who dreamed the fondest of all Roman dreams: restoring theRepublic. Still, my father ruled.And though I seek only to fulfill his dream, I too must rule. Fordespite the gossip of philosophers men are not born free; they musthave freedom given them by the state.GRACCHUSAre you alleging, Caesar, that our citizens' desire for the Republic isinfantile?COMMODUSMen who believe they can truly be free, like it or not, are necessarily children.FALCOAnd like children everywhere they scream "freedom" the most when theydesire it least. I beg you, please continue, Caesar.COMMODUSAt the opening of the month of Janus, I will ask this noble body toconfirm my emperorship...Gracchus points out toward the street.GRACCHUSWe don't have to wait for the month of Janus, the people deny youalready!COMMODUSIt is you, Gaius and you Gracchus who incite the people until they areout of control!GAIUSIt is not the Senate's duty to control the people, rather to allowthem the right to control us!FALCOGentlemen, gentlemen: our emperor has come here humbly to address us about his confirmation...VOICEIf there is a confirmation!FALCO... and I insist we show him the respect and honor he is due.GRACCHUSCaesar, what are you doing about this growing grain shortage? Ifthere is unrest now, what happens when there is no bread at all?GAIUSAnd that treaty!
