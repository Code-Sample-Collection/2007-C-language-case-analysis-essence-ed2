Studies serve for delight,
for ornament,
and for ability.
Their chief use for delight,
is in privateness and retiring;
for ornament, is in discourse; 
and for ability, 
is in the judgement and disposition of business.
For ecpert and execute, 
and perhaps judge of particulars,
one by one; but the general counsels,
and the plots and marshalling of affairs, 
come best form those that are learned. 
To spend too much time in studies is sloth;
to use them too much for ornament,
is affectation; 
to make judgement wholly by their rules,
is the humour of a scholar.
They perfect nature,
and are perfectec by experience:
for natural abilities are like natural plants,
that need proyning by study;
and studies themselves do give forth directions
too much at large, 
except they be bounded in by experience.
Crafty men contemn studies,
simple men admire them,
and wise men use them;
for they teach not their own use;
but that is a wisdom without them,
and above them, won by observation.
